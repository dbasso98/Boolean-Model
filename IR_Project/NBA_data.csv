"(Shelburne in ESPN piece) Still, Leonard's recruiting efforts caught George by surprise. Said one source close to George, ""For a quiet guy, he's a hell of a recruiter.""", Another interesting tidbit Then Durant got a call from Kawhi Leonard asking if he d consider teaming up with him and signing with the LA Clippers They d be a great complement to each other Leonard told Durant He d always admired him and had tremendous respect for him as a competitor Durant was flattered and more than a little stunned according to sources close to the situation He didn t know Leonard that well so getting a recruiting call like that made a real impression ,t3_c9tph1
"[Wojnarowski] Oklahoma City is trading All-Star Paul George to the Los Angeles Clippers for a record-setting collection of draft choices, league sources tell ESPN.",,t3_c9q6ej

[Stein] Incredible. Kawhi Leonard gave the Clippers more time to acquire the second star he insisted on and the Clippers pulled it off by striking a deal to acquire Paul George from the Thunder,,t3_c9q6ya
"[Wojnarowski] Sources: Oklahoma City is getting a massive package of future picks, including Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Danilo Galllinari, to deliver Kawhi Leonard who he wanted to partner with: Paul George.",,t3_c9q75o

[Markazi] Lakers contingent is upset Kawhi Leonard chose the Clippers obviously but more shocked the Thunder paved the way with the Paul George trade. Completely blindsided by that.,,t3_c9qcx5
OKC fans to Raptor fans this season., Anything s possible we convinced PG to stay maybe you guys can do the same with Kawhi ,t3_c9qrlz
"[Wojnarowski] In the end, Toronto didn't have assets to satisfy OKC --- with or without Siakam in any proposed deal. The fear of Toronto entering into trade talks with OKC only proved to guarantee the Clippers would go the distance with five first-round picks and SGA in deal for George.",,t3_c9tllr

They have to face the Lakers, Clippers and Warriors 4x next year",I feel for Suns fans That s a murderers row for a division and it s not going to be fun playing the Clippers and Lakers on a back to back in staples I know they weren t contending but no team wants to be in a divison this stacked Hell even the Kings are going to be half decent,t3_c9qore
"[Discussion] The NBA ""superteam"" era has temporarily halted for the ""duo"" era",Lakers LeBron and Anthony Davis Clippers Kawhi and Paul George Nets Durant and Kyrie Irving Warriors Steph Curry and Klay Thompson The most common characteristic these teams and others have exactly two superstars with them alongside other players ,t3_c9qbta
"[Wojnarowski] The Clippers are sending the Thunder four unprotected first-round picks, one protected first-round pick and two pick swaps, league sources tell ESPN. Those picks go to OKC with Gallinari and SGA.",,t3_c9q8n8

"[Wojnarowski] Raptors nearly traded for Paul George, Russell Westbrook to try to keep Kawhi. Presti leveraged Clippers and Raptors against eachother to create unprecedented haul", Seems Presti continues his streak of killing it as GM once more Both teams knew PG is what Kawhi wanted and I guess the Raptors thought the price would be too high firsts to pay given their already insane tax bill plus george and or westbrook on top of that,t3_c9ua89
"[Shelburne] JaVale McGee has agreed to return to the Lakers, where he‚Äôll likely start at center, league sources tell ESPN. It‚Äôs a two-year, $8.2 million deal, with a player option.",,t3_c9qtz1
"[Shelburne] Much will be made of the Lakers and Raptors end of this. But as of about 2 hours before Leonard chose the Clippers Friday night, his camp was asking the Lakers to delay the AD trade until Sat/Sun, sources tell ESPN. No reason given. Just a condition.",,t3_c9ssvw
"So Kawhi, PG, and Westbrook could have all found themselves playing for the Raptors.",This is wild Clippers leadership Ballmer Frank and general manager Michael Winger harbored fears that Presti was close to striking a deal with Toronto that would have delivered George to Leonard and the NBA champions sources said Had Presti been able to strike a deal for George with Toronto and Leonard was willing to stay George was believed to be willing to join the Raptors sources said Presti pursued a package of Russell Westbrook and George to the Raptors with the NBA s Most Improved Player forward Pascal Siakam as the centerpiece of a broader asset crippling deal but Ujiri couldn t keep up with the Clippers willingness to unload unprotected first round picks into the middle of the next decade league sources said Simply Toronto didn t have the depth of picks it needed to get a deal done nor the certainty that getting George would make Leonard stay with the Raptors sources said ,t3_c9tq5k
[Serious] Can/Will Kawhi/Clippers get fined for tampering with Paul George?,The NBA can fine any player or team that directly or indirectly entices induces persuades or attempts to entice induce or persuade anyone under contract with another team for their services Seems as though Kawhi meeting with PG falls under the realm ,t3_c9qk46
"If the Lakers and the Clippers play each other in the playoffs, would it be the first time in NBA history that all games of a playoff series happen in the same arena?",If the Lakers and the Clippers play each other in the playoffs would it be the first time in NBA history that all games of a playoff series happen in the same arena Both play in the Staples arena,t3_c9us81
The NBA Reacts to the Kawhi Trade (Twitter),,t3_c9teli
Let's thank Kawhi for restoring balance to the NBA.,There s more parity in this league than ever before thanks to Kawhi s decision to join the LA Clippers ,t3_c9qp8y
Kawhi is out here playing My Career,He grinded his attributes amp badges maxing his offensive game in the Spurs elevated himself to become a star player Got bored staying in the same team Traded himself to a team that had long been failing to get a chip Dominated that shit stayed for just one season so that he won t get bored again He then moves to another relatively weaker yet somewhat promising team hoping to give them a chip like some kind of benevolent God Helped bring parity by refusing to form Super team to the league so the game remains challenging and fun ,t3_c9vqp3

"Thank you Kawhi for being amazing, professional, a ""Fun Guy"" and bringing us over the edge. We will always be fans and grateful. Best of luck with the Clippers!",We waited a long time for a championship here in Toronto We have been sort of good pretty good very good for a while now but just weren t able to get there Being on the precipice of greatness had definitely taken its toll Thank you for helping us reach that final level and achieve our goal decades in the making Can t say we re not sad to see you go but we understand Toronto loves you and will always have your back Best of luck in the future ,t3_c9s2if
"Now that the Clippers have Kawhi and Paul George, it's time they get their own stadium and re-design their logo to further differentiate themselves.",After the incredible unimaginable acquisitions of Kawhi and PG the Clippers should get their own stadium in a different part of LA to further build their own identity rather than being the Lakers lil bro at the Staples center The Clippers should also add a literal clipper which is a sail ship to one of their logos something like this I do not know the author so if someone tells me I ll be happy to credit them The current logos are too generic and hold no flavor ,t3_c9ub0p

How critical Reddit has been about Adrian Wojnarowski,Just days ago before free agency begins a post was made about how Woj shows favoritism for the Clippers More than awards have been spent on the post All the talk about investigating NBA reporter and days later he was right all along Link to the post I was referring it is fair to think that adrian wojnarowski ,t3_c9scug
"Lost in all the commotion is the fact that Raptors, reigning Champions, will now go another year without a Christmas game",I actually thought they would get it this year but having no marquee players anymore and playing in Canada makes them an unattractive team for a Christmas game yet again ,t3_c9u162
Leaks really change the perception,Kawhi to the Clippers was rumored for a year by a number of sources Then all it took was a few talking heads with no real sources to say I m hearing lakers and this entire sub and the nba in general was convinced that s where he was signing ,t3_c9ued5
Is Russell Westbrook being traded?,Why would they keep an aging star who relies mostly on athleticism It s gonna be a miracle for them to find another star now anyway Where would be the best fits for Russ ,t3_c9qbo4
"3 months ago, after an OKC-Raps game: ‚ÄúPaul George said he's spoken to Kawhi about his experience in a similar situation last year (coming to a new team and facing free agency before ultimately deciding to stay in OKC). What advice did he have? ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs between us.‚Äô ‚Äú", Tweet from Josh Lewenburg on March article on incident here Originally people though this meant PG was convincing Kawhi to stay give Toronto a shot Was this actually then planning to join up in the summer This incident takes on a whole new meaning now ,t3_c9r4yp
Earthquake felt in Las Vegas during the Knicks v Pelicans Summer League game.,Unsure why I made that sound like a news article headline It s just me watching and making observations while drunk amp nbsp amp nbsp Edit nailed it ,t3_c9oyft
Can we just appreciate Kawhi's decision as neutral fans?,Either Toronto or Clippers woulda been good choices for basketball fans overall Clippers is the best because they haven t won a title and they have a good front office right now and a good squad Kawhi did not go to Lebron and AD to form a Super team he did not care about Snoop Dogg recruiting him to the Lakers he did not care about companies offering him free condos and airplanes in Toronto or drake recruiting him he made the best basketball decision for everyone well except Lakers fans and Raptors tho he gave them a title so they are happy about the whole deal Props to Kawhi real guy that for whatever reason has absolutely been nothing but a pleasure to the NBA fan ,t3_c9qxo0
[OC] How the Nets and Clippers set themselves up to be the biggest winners of 2019 Free Agency,The Nets and Clippers just pulled off one of the most exciting free agency heists together signing the biggest FAs on the market ahead of the storied franchises that share their cities years ago neither of these teams was in the playoffs and now they re both presumptive title contenders depending on the health of Kevin Durant I wanted to make a timeline of the important FO decisions both teams have made over the past couple years to show how they were able to develop the culture accumulate the young talent and assets and create the cap space that it requires to become a convincing FA destination Brooklyn Nets February Nets hire Sean Marks as their GM The move that started it all The Nets had a record at this point in the season and all signs were pointing towards a rebuild Marks was previously the assistant GM of the Spurs and was hired shortly after Billy King s problematic tenure as GM was brought to an end Thanks to Billy Marks had to find a way to make the Nets competitive again without owning any of their own FRPs for the next years May Nets hire Kenny Atkinson as their head coach Atkinson had previously spent years as an assistant coach in the NBA most recently with the Hawks under Budenholzer Atkinson was noted for his player development skills and intended on bringing a fast paced modern offense to the Nets June Nets trade Thaddeus Young to the Pacers for the th pick in the draft Caris Levert Nets traded for Thaddeus Young from the Timberwolves the previous season for Kevin Garnett and didn t have a first rounder in this draft so getting themselves a pick here was big They ended up selecting Caris Levert who has turned out great for them July Nets sign Jeremy Lin to a year $ M contract Trevor Booker to a year $ M contract and Joe Harris to a year $ M contract Made a couple other small signings but Lin and Booker were the major ones Joe Harris was an afterthought at the time but has proven to be one of the best diamonds in the rough the Nets managed to find December Nets sign Spencer Dinwiddie I just said in that last section that Joe Harris was one of the best diamonds in the rough the Nets managed to find but I think it s fair to say that Dinwiddie has ended up being THE best one Dinwiddie was a second round pick by the Pistons in and spent most of his first two seasons playing in the G League but he ended up having a solid season with the Nets averaging and shooting from the field and from February Nets trade Bojan Bodganovic and Chris McCullough to the Wizards for Andrew Nicholson Marcus Thornton and a lottery protected FRP The Nets signed Bojan out of Europe in and got some good production out of him averaged PPG on pt shooting but his age and impending FA made it pretty clear he had no longterm future with the team Nets took on Nicholson s bad contract years and $ M left on a contract for a guy that was essentially unplayable and ended up getting the nd pick in the draft to add to the pick swap they had with Boston season recap Nets were ass and were without Jeremy Lin for most of the season but under Atkinson they managed to institute a fast paced in the league in pace pt heavy in the league in PA offense and had pretty encouraging seasons from some of their young players mainly Caris LeVert and Rondae Hollis Jefferson June Nets draft Jarrett Allen with the nd pick Long athletic center out of Texas Many had him projected as high as the late lottery so snagging him at had some steal potential for the Nets spoiler alert it was a steal Allen was drafted with the pick received in the Bogdanovic trade Nets trade the th pick and Brook Lopez for D Angelo Russell and Timofey Mozgov I would call this Marks first blockbuster move He makes another cap sacrifice here taking on Mozgov s ugly contract with years still remaining and giving up Lopez s expiring deal but receives a young guard with a lot of potential in D Angelo Russell At this point it s still questionable whether D Lo ever becomes a star or not after two up and down seasons with the Lakers but it s the type of gamble the Nets have to take without any of their own lottery picks July Nets trade Justin Hamilton to the Toronto Raptors for DeMarre Carroll a FRP and a SRP and trade Andrew Nicholson to the Portland Trail Blazers for Allen Crabbe Nets back at it again using their extensive cap space to absorb bad contracts and get some assets for it Along with the picks the Nets added guys that could actually contribute to the team DeMarre Carroll though coming off an injury plagued tenure in Toronto could still bring a much needed amp D presence to the Nets while Allen Crabbe gave them a spot up shooter that they had already tried to sign Blazers matched their offer sheet in season recap Not a lot of trades with longterm implications happen through the season besides a couple nd rounders changing hands but the Nets have one of their most encouraging seasons in a while They still suck finished largely due to knee injuries suffered by both Lin and D Lo but at this point they ve really begun to develop an identity and culture and the season brought a lot of positive player development in LeVert Hollis Jefferson and Dinwiddie along with an encouraging rookie season from Jarrett Allen June Nets trade Timofey Mozgov a SRP and a SRP to the Charlotte Hornets for Dwight Howard The Nets are able to move on from the next years of Mozgov s salary by receiving an expiring contract in Dwight Howard who they reach a buyout agreement with at the expense of SRPs This move helped give the Nets some of the flexibility they needed to go after free agents in Nets draft Dzanan Musa with the th pick and Rodions Kurucs with the th pick Last year where the Nets don t have their own pick Draft two Euro forwards July Nets trade Isaiah Whitehead to the Denver Nuggets for Kenneth Faried Darrell Arthur and a top protected FRP and a SRP After giving up some picks to dump a salary Nets go back to their old ways and take some picks to absorb some salary So in this offseason the Nets managed to give up one of the worst contracts in the league at the expense of second rounders but were able to get back a FRP and a SRP to take on two EXPIRING contracts That s what I call Marks Magic Nets re sign Joe Harris to a year $ M deal sign Ed Davis to a year $ contract and trade Darrell Arthur to the Phoenix Suns for Jared Dudley and a SRP Nets retain their sharpshooter Joe Harris and add two vets in Jared Dudley and Ed Davis both of which would become important contributors to the team both on and off the court Nets decide NOT to sign Rondae Hollis Jefferson and D Angelo Russell to extensions This was a pretty big decision by Marks He had set this team up perfectly to have plenty of cap space in the summer of but would have to put himself at risk of exposing two of their most promising young players to RFA Marks ends up taking the risk spoiler alert it pays off big time December Nets sign Spencer Dinwiddie to a year $ M contract extension Nets are able to keep their coveted th man on a team friendly contract after his hot start to the season season recap THE NETS DO NOT SUCK They finish th in the East at making the playoffs for the first time since behind breakout All Star D Angelo Russell and a strong supporting cast The Nets continued building on the identity and culture that Atkinson had established while improving their defense to the upper half of the league th in DRTG June Nets trade Allen Crabbe and the th pick and a protected FRP to the Atlanta Hawks for Taurean Prince and a SRP The last move the Nets needed to do to make space Also allowed them to add Taurean Prince who should be another cheap roleplayer that can contribute on a competing team next season July Y all already know Summary The Nets put their faith in Sean Marks and it worked With a great coaching hire a clear plan and direction excellent cap management a willingness to both acquire and trade assets to absorb or clear salary and some very good drafting he was able to build a contender in years with only one of the Nets own draft picks Los Angeles Clippers June Clippers hire Jerry West as a consultant The logo himself West has quite the track record as an executive x Executive of the Year in fact serving as the GM of the Lakers through the s and s and the Grizzlies through the s not to mention he was an executive board member on the Warriors during their Finals runs Clippers trade Chris Paul to the Houston Rockets for Patrick Beverley Lou Williams Sam Dekker Montrezl Harrell and a FRP The official ending of the Lob City Era Clippers are pretty lucky they got anything in return for CP considering he could ve opted out and signed somewhere as a FA This haul would become one of the most important parts of their rebuild July Clippers re sign Blake Griffin to a year $ M contract This was considered a pretty questionable move at the time Tying so much money to a guy that had been battling injuries for the previous seasons was a bit of a risk especially after already losing your other star player Clippers agree to three way sign and trade sending Diamond Stone Jamal Crawford and a FRP for Danilo Gallinari year $ M contract Clippers were able to round out their front court with scoring forward Gallinari who was coming off a strong season with the Nuggets August Clippers relieve Doc Rivers of GM duties and promote Lawrence Frank to Head of Basketball Operations The second big FO change of the summer for the Clippers Frank formerly served as Executive Vice President of Basketball Operations for the Clippers after coaching in the NBA for several years January Clippers trade Blake Griffin Brice Johnson and Willie Reed to the Detroit Pistons for Tobias Harris Avery Bradley Boban Marjanovic and a FRP Didn t take long for the Clippers to backtrack from that Blake Griffin signing after a mediocre start to the season They came away with a very solid package adding Tobias Harris a young scoring forward in the middle of the best season of his career after making major improvements to his jumpshot plus an unprotected FRP But the biggest thing from this trade was that the Clippers didn t have to worry about paying Blake Griffin $ M year for the next seasons February Clippers sign Lou Williams to a year $ M contract extension Clippers retain their PPG bench scorer Lou Williams on a very team friendly deal season recap Clippers made a valiant effort at the playoffs but came up games short finishing at th in the West at Injuries forced them to dig deep with players like Sindarius Thornwell and Tyrone Wallace finding themselves getting major minutes But overall they remained a competitive team thanks to some great coaching from Doc Rivers and big contributions from MOTY Lou Williams rim rollers DeAndre Jordan and Montrezl Harrell and the newly acquired Tobias Harris June Clippers draft Miles Bridges with the th pick traded along with SRPs to Charlotte for Shai Gilgeous Alexander and Jerome Robinson with the th pick Jerry West had his eye on Gilgeous Alexander and was willing to trade two second rounders to make sure he got him The pick used to acquire him was from Detroit in the Blake Griffin trade Clippers trade Austin Rivers to the Washington Wizards for Marcin Gortat I guess this matters but in the long run it really didn t July Clippers re sign Montrezl Harrell to year $ M contract Clippers keep their young and productive backup big on a team friendly contract after letting DJ walk February Clippers trade Tobias Harris Boban Marjanovic and Mike Scott to the Philadelphia ers for Landry Shamet Wilson Chandler Mike Muscala a FRP a FRP and two SRPs With the intention of creating as much cap space as possible to sign some of the upcoming marquee free agents the Clippers had no interest in re signing Tobias Harris to the large contract it looked like he would command in free agency Trading him in the middle of his borderline All Star season allowed them to add some nice assets and a young player in Shamet that was ready to contribute The Clippers essentially turned Blake Griffin on a bloated contract into Shai Gilgeous Alexander Landry Shamet and two future FRPs These assets came in handy very soon spoiler alert it got them Paul George Season recap The Clippers end up being one of the most fun teams in the NBA finishing behind the unstoppable bench duo of Lou Williams and Montrezl Harrell their departed leading scorer Tobias Harris some big contributions from the finally healthy Danilo Gallinari and Patrick Beverly and a promising rookie season from Shai Gilgeous Alexander This team played hard and with heart which was put on full display in their playoff series against the Warriors July Y all already know Summary With Steve Ballmer at the head the Clippers have been able to restructure their front office to make themselves one of the best organizations in the league With some brilliant trades and well spent cap room the Clippers were able to pull off one of the biggest trades of the year Paul George and land one of the most coveted free agents Kawhi Leonard ,t3_c9vr61
"The Thunder ultimately traded 1 year of Serge Ibaka for 4 unprotected firsts, one protected first, two pick swaps, Gallo and Shai Gilgeous Alexander",It s sad PG is leaving but it is incredible what Presti managed to do with trading Serge on his expiring contract Embrace the tank with tank commander Ray Ray Felton ,t3_c9qrh2
"Cris Carter on Kawhi Leonard: I believe there's going to be an announcement today.""", For Kawhi this is about which organization is going to support his quest to be the best player in the world and get as many championships as possible To me the only team that presents that is the Lakers I believe there s going to be an announcement today ,t3_c9fos6
[Michael Grange] Sooo ... I feel confident saying that Kawhi was in Toronto as of Thursday night and was unlikely to have been on the MSLE corporate jet that apparently left early Friday morning for San Diego and is apparently on its way back Toronto this afternoon. That's all I got.,,t3_c9kdss

Russell Westbrook is averaging 27-9-10 over the last 5 seasons. Russell Westbrook has been an all-NBA player in 8 of the last 9 seasons. Russell Westbrook has missed just 14 games in the last 4 seasons.,A lot of debate over the last couple days over Russell Westbrook s value in a potential trade It almost feels like most people are premeditating assuming a serious or long term injury to Westbrook over the next years because of his style of play as opposed to him actually being injured John Wall is injured right now yes and will likely be out till December January next season Chris Paul has shown himself to be injury prone for most of his career and is years old so yes there s a likelihood you could expect miss to miss maybe games next season Steph Curry has missed games in the last seasons while Kyrie Irving has missed regular season Westbrook has only missed games in the last seasons Russell Westbrook is years old right now and likely has years of all NBA level play left in him He elevates any team he goes to I get that the Zach Lowe s of the world have been preaching about the low value of Westbrook s contract but I mean good luck finding an injury free all NBA level player around the league that s available ,t3_ca8b1q

I love Russell Westbrook‚Äôs game,People who call Westbrook a bad player usually don t watch Thunder games Even though I m a Blazer fan I love his competitive energy and his back and forths with Dame It s sad that so many people hate him because he s the most athletic pound for pound player in NBA history and he is a very creative playmaker I don t care that he isn t no DJ Augustin who takes efficient shots I love the recklessness Westbrook plays with Westbrook is in the last part of his prime and hopefully we can appreciate what he has done for the league,t3_caa6ip

The biggest reason why casual fans misvalue players - Free Throw Attempts Per Game,I ve noticed a trend oftentimes when there is a player for whom impact stats analytics vary greatly from the conventional wisdom of casual fans they re a player that either gets to the line a ton or fails to do so Imagine Klay Thompson shooting last season from on his same amount of attempts That s the value Harden provides from the FT line Now let me backtrack and show you how I got there Getting a shooting foul is the most valuable shot an offensive player can get For an FT shooter that s an expected pts per possession If you crank it up to an elite FT shooter it s Even if a guy only shoots from the line the EV of his free throws are still Compare that to other types of shots If you re getting to the rim an free throw shooter would have to convert at the rim of the time for their layup attempt to be more valuable than free throws On a pointer it s almost equally impossible to surpass the value of FT attempts from which is incredible is an expected pts per possession so equivalent to a FT shooter Point of all this being it s essentially impossible to get off higher EV shots from the field than FT attempts from a FT shooter All this ties into my title because fans don t seem to value getting to the line as much as they value other attributes It seems like almost all casual fans thinks guys who consistently make difficult contested shots from be they layups or mid rangers or guys who drain from are better than those who can get to the line consistently This makes sense as it s a much more exciting play and it feels like the player is doing more but it s absolutely incorrect from a value to winning perspective Let s connect this to players for whom impact stats and other analytics differ in value from fan perception Klay Thompson FTA per game D Angelo Russell FTA per game CJ McCollum FTA per game Mike Conley FTA per game Danillo Gallinari FTA per game James Harden FTA per game I think most fans here would consider D Angelo Russell and Mike Conley to be somewhat similar in terms of value but analytics indicate they re not even remotely close Free throw attempts is a great explanation for why that difference in perception exists Russell shoots from the line and gets there times per game that s pts per game from the line Conley shoots on attempts which is pts per game from the line So that s an extra pts per game from free throws alone That might not sound like a lot but it s a ton in terms of value Picture a guy hitting an extra s per season on the exact same amount of attempts and that s the difference in value here Put another way Kyrie Irving shot from last year if he increased his value provided from pt attempts by the same amount as the difference in value between Conley s and Russell s pts from the FT line he d be a pt shooter So the gap in value between Russell and Conley from the line is the same as the gap in value between what Kyrie Irving did last year and what he hypothetically would have done had he shot from which everyone probably would have made him MVP To do another comparison Harden added extra pts from the line as compared to Klay Thompson last year For fun with this same line of thinking if Klay wanted to recoup that extra value Harden provides from the line on pointers he d have to shoot from on his PA per game None of this even factors in the fact that drawing fouls knocks opposing players out of game when they get in foul trouble or foul out or that racking up fouls gets the whole team in the bonus quicker tl dr Fans don t understand how absurdly valuable FT attempts are and this creates gaps in perception between how valuable we think guys are from just watching them versus how much they actually impact winning ,t3_cacn1j

In the greater Los Angeles area what percent of basketball fans are Lakers fans vs clippers fans?,My cousin recently came to visit me from Los Angeles I live on the east coast We talked about Kawhi and the general NBA landscape in general That got me wondering what the fan base between the clippers and lakers were slept like I know that the Lakers are much more popular than the clippers but what is the ratio like My cousin who s a lakers fan told me it s like in favor of the lakers He s obviously biased though so I m thinking maybe it s more like or maybe in favor of the Lakers He told me I have no idea what I m talking about and to be fair I really don t when it comes to Los Angeles and that the lakers are far far far more popular So in the greater Los Angeles area how are the basketball fans split between the two teams ,t3_ca9k0a
[OC] Fanbase Happiness Power Rankings, I did this a few years ago and after the enormous upheaval of the past few weeks I think it s time to take another look Bear in mind these are all just my opinion and that I m an idiot and I forget tons of shit all the time I m just bored at work TIER aka Somebody pinch me LA Clippers I mean you just pulled off what most people were saying was impossible and although it cost you a ton of picks you didn t have to gut the team Set up to contend for the next years and even better it came at the expense of the Lakers TIER aka Man this off season was so close to being perfect Brooklyn Nets You did it you got your two stars and like the Clippers you plucked them from right under your big brother s nose The only issue here is that KD got injured so this season is probably not one where you re gonna contend Still what a massive vote of confidence in the Nets operation LA Lakers AD is a Laker and the roster around him isn t a disaster Getting two timed by Kawhi has gotta sting but there are at least competent NBA players around your star duo so you should definitely be a contender regardless TIER aka Kawhi has gone omg Philadelphia ers Jimmy and Reddick are gone but most people would argue you got better With Kawhi going West it now looks a lot like a two horse race in the East and Horford might be a huge addition Milwaukee Bucks Brogdon left but there is a decent chance a trade is in the works to reinforce the guard spots You have the MVP a great shot at making the Finals and the reigning Executive Coach of the Year Bucks making the Finals looks like at the worst a outcome Toronto Raptors Bittersweet maybe but that title is going to go down in legend It will still be a lot of fun watching Siakham blossom into hopefully a proper All Star this year and the books are totally clean after this season Excited to see what Masai and Nurse cook up TIER aka Funny how things turn out huh New Orleans Pelicans Things were looking pretty bleak there for a while but the AD haul was substantial and then you won the lottery Now you ve got all those Lakers youngsters Zion a bunch of picks and some smart free agent signings Making the playoffs this year could be tough given how stacked the West is but it doesn t feel like the wait will be long TIER aka I can almost talk myself into thinking we re a contender Utah Jazz Some big moves needed to happen and your front office made them Mitchell will be a year older Conley is a great addition and Gobert is still a beast So long as Conley stays healthy I d be feeling good about my chances against anyone so long as the young players keep developing Denver Nuggets Jokic kicked ass in his first playoff outing and you committed major money to Murray Hopefully everyone kicks on from last season and Jokic cements himself as a top player The hope is you ll be a more complete team with better health than the Lakers and maybe you can leverage that into another great regular season Houston Rockets The Warriors are gone and you could make an argument that the Rockets are now the best team in the West because it s only really the Warriors who have been able to stop them It must also be gratifying that all the talk of locker room turmoil amounted to nothing Still CP is probably going to decline every year so the window if it still exists is closing all the time Portland Trailblazers I actually like the Whiteside addition a lot because he fits with how your defense works perfectly Losing wing depth is tough in this league but it s still exciting to think about how this revamped team will look Dame also solidified his claim to having the biggest balls in the league and then doubled down on committing to your team other stars be damned That s cool as hell TIER aka Let s just see how this looks then I ll get back to you Indiana Pacers Oladipo will be back you got Brogdon Collison retired Bogdanovic and Young left What a weird mixed bag of an off season Still you were excellent last season and Turner was getting into the DPOY conversation If he takes another leap and Brogdon is worth his contract you should be be a top seed in the East again Boston Celtics Losing Kyrie was probably a blessing rather than a curse by the end and replacing him with Kemba at least ensures that you ll still field an All Star at PG Losing Horford and Baynes hurts though because it s tough to see how the defense doesn t take a step back Still Tatum and Brown will still develop you got rid of Toxic Terry and Hayward will hopefully be better another year removed from his injury Dallas Mavericks This had all the makings of a Tier team along with the Pelicans but then everyone in Dallas sat on their hands instead of adding talent around your young stars The key here obviously is Porzingis looking like his old self if he does you ll be a hugely exciting young team with playoff aspirations and a big future if he doesn t then you re hoping it s fun watching Luka develop while KP works back towards being fully fit TIER aka Well that could have gone worse I guess Golden State Warriors Losing KD and Klay to injury was awful losing KD to the Nets was salt in the wound Still getting what will be regarded around the league as a big asset back means that you can reconfigure the roster going forward if the Russell Curry backcourt doesn t bear fruit Keeping Looney helps a lot too San Antonio Spurs Last year was always going to be odd with so many departures but I think Dejounte being out masked how good of a team you still are Smart off season pickups and I think you ll end up like last year s Clippers a far better and more cohesive team than people expect and a nightmare Round matchup in the playoffs TIER aka We re gonna be fun to watch at least Atlanta Hawks I think this is a really smart rebuild I like the bold moves in the draft and Trae Young is just such a great entertainer Even with the weakened East I have difficulty seeing you as a playoff team this year but as a Hawks fan I d be really happy about how the front office are playing this A few years away maybe Sacramento Kings This off season was more of a lateral move than a definite step up Still last season exceeded expectations and you were most people s League Pass darlings I d be kinda bummed you couldn t figure out a way to have a Cousins return but maybe Kings fans don t care Memphis Grizzlies Ja JJJ are gonna be good and in general I think you had a solid summer so far It was time to part with Conley and Mark but I think you got pretty solid value for them and I doubt you ll be out of playoff contention for too long Orlando Magic I mean you didn t make any seismic moves but personally I think it s pretty cool that an All Star signed a long term contract with you rather than leaving That s a pretty solid endorsement of where the franchise is heading Playoffs are obviously a realistic goal again but the real difference maker would be Fultz at some point becoming a positive contributor If he somehow turns his career around and becomes a competent starting point guard you d be in the mix for a top spot Detroit Pistons Rose is a gamble but one that I think you needed to make This team was crying out for a dynamic ball handling guard and if Rose s shooting holds up I think he ll be great value You also had limited flexibility while obviously needing to try something different so this is probably the best you could have hoped for I m positive about it and I think with a healthy Blake and Rose you ll have a team capable of pulling off some shock wins when they re hot Miami Heat I mean personally I think your moves make no sense but whatever At least there s a star in Miami again Thing is you re stuck with these guys now and they re obviously not good enough to finish better than around th My hope is you figure out a way to get Russ because watching Russ and Jimmy share the ball would be hilarious TIER aka I doubt we ll even be that fun but at least there s a glimmer of hope Chicago Bulls The young guys should come on If Lauri Carter can play games that d be great and I think you drafted well I just don t know that anyone of these guys are gonna be good enough this year to win many games Lavine might have a fantastic season and push for an All Star spot given how talent starved the East is so that ll probably be the highlight Oklahoma City Thunder I mean this had to happen at some point right The picks probably won t be great for a while so in the next couple of years I d be banking on SGA being a stud and trying to flip what other competent players you have into more picks Still although it sucks that PG ditched you at least the haul was enormous The Clippers might well be a totally different team before they ve finished their pick obligations from this trade so those later picks might be gold Cleveland Cavaliers You re gonna be truly awful this year but the front office seem to be making sensible decisions Kevin Love having a good opening few months and then getting moved to a contender for some assets would help brighten the future a little Still probably facing a few seasons at the bottom of the pile to be honest Phoenix Suns I just wish I knew what the plan was Weird draft decisions weird trade decisions weird free agent decisions Booker and to some extent Ayton deserve better How many more years will Booker say he s done missing the playoffs before he decides to take matters into his own hands Still there s just about enough raw talent here that you can t rule out a slight uptick in fortunes Minnesota Timberwolves So much of this depends on Wiggins If he figures some stuff out you re back on track or if you re able to move him you can at least build something different around Towns If he s still bad and noone wants him it looks increasingly unlikely that you ll be a Western playoff team any time soon KAT is such an enormous talent that you have to figure out a way to maximise his early prime if you want to keep him long term Getting Russell would have helped so maybe there s a trade to be done there after Dec th TIER aka I never really liked basketball anyway so this is fine New York Knicks Oof that had to hurt It wouldn t be so bad if Dolan hadn t hyped up this summer for months but noone even taking a look at MSG as a landing spot is a proper reality check It s similar to the Lakers not landing Kawhi players are showing they do give a shit about joining well run franchises The Nets and the Clippers did things the right way and they usurped their neighbours as a result Still you did add enough competent players that bottoming out completely this year doesn t appear likely Washington Wizards No GM for the draft or free agency and you re applying for a Disabled Player Exception for John Wall which means he s likely out for the entirety of next season Bradley Beal says all the right things but what is the point of him being on the Wizards Whoever your eventual GM is they really need to work out what the hell the plan is Charlotte Hornets Landed Terry Rozier at a huge discount got rid of the cancerous locker room presence that

Some funny Chinese nicknames of NBA players and how these name came,I wanna to write some funny Chinese nicknames of famous NBA players hope you can also get it Firstly in China the fans of Lebron James will call him Old Ja or year old man It s because we all know he used to be the young king but now he is old People are trying to make fun just like when he made a crazy dunk or block his fans will say It s not a big deal he is just an old man Secondly the fans of Kobe will call him My boss They think Kobe is the big brother of them By the way the nickname of Paul Gasol is Sister in law Ga it s because in Chinese the sol in Gasol sounds like the word which means sister in law The nickname of Durant is a little handsome boy That s because once some NBA fans said he is not very pretty and lots of fans of him use Photoshop to make him look very good So people start to call him a little handsome boy The nickname of Steph Curry used to be Cute God and that s because of his babyface But now his nickname becomes the Skyf ker that s because when a talented player join the league we will say His limitation is the sky But in the past of year Curry beat all of them he was like saying Sky what So he got the new nickname However the most funny thing is Since Damian Lillard used to beat Curry once in season So he got a nickname the Skyf ker f ker ,t3_caa60o

"[OC] The L.A. Clippers may be the best team in the league right now, but they may not be a ""super team"" quite yet",Ever since the shocking news about Kawhi Leonard and Paul George the Los Angeles Clippers have emerged as the betting favorite in Vegas to win the title And they genuinely may be They should be a great team However there are some signs that the hype may be slightly overboard based on a few factors outlined here overachievement in This past season the Clippers went an incredible record given the expectations However there are certain advanced stats that suggest that the win total may have been an overachievement Among them the Clippers had a point differential on the year which is a good mark but one that s below standard for a team in their win range To illustrate the win Boston Celtics had a differential the win Oklahoma City Thunder were the win Indiana Pacers registered and the win San Antonio Spurs logged The Western Conference is tougher than the East but even if we make that adjustment the Clippers overachieved SRS Simple Rating System is a stat that adjusts for schedule By that metric the Clippers had a rating of th in the NBA Again that falls behind teams in their win range like the Celtics Thunder Pacers and Spurs Given all that it s no surprise that expected W L record claims the Clippers should have gone given their advanced stat performance Realistically wins feels like a reasonable outcome for last year s squad a for e ward to this year The Clippers are going to trot out a wing combination of Kawhi Leonard and Paul George which may be one of the best in recent memory I m extremely excited to see how those two do on the defensive end they may be the best pair of defensive wings since Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen That said let s not underestimate the performance of the Clippers previous forwards Tobias Harris and Danilo Gallinari Both are good players who happened to have extraordinary years for the Clips last year In the games prior to his trade Tobias Harris shot from beyond the arc In his games played Danilo Gallinari shot from three himself Those are blazing hot numbers even when judged through the context of two good shooters their career averages are and respectively Obviously Kawhi Leonard and Paul George will be clear improvements at forward but the question becomes a matter of how much If you trust ESPN s wins added stat then Kawhi PG would have added your team wins last year Now again that comes with the caveat about the accuracy of this stat It relies heavily on RPM which largely feels fair but does have some outliers The stat loved Paul George s defensive impact in RPM and hasn t charted Kawhi Leonard as an elite regular season defender in some time only last year The truth is probably somewhere in between Leonard didn t play like a shutdown defender all year long but he s obviously a good defender anyway Of course we can t simply take the Clippers win total and add because we re losing two good forwards in the process Tobias Harris and Danilo Gallinari would have combined for wins last year Overall they re suggesting that this upgrade is good for about wins Rather than debate the accuracy of these stats the purpose is merely to suggest that the Clippers forwards a red hot half season of Tobias Harris and a healthy Danilo Gallinari aren t anything to scoff at watering down the Sweet Lou If you want to boil down the Clippers surprising success last season you can credit a few factors However the primary one may have been the stellar bench play of Lou Williams and Montrezl Harrell Williams in particular has thrived in his current role off the bench The production per minute is staggering He averaged points and assists in only minutes a night However it s difficult to see Williams playing the exact same role again Effectively he was the Clippers lead option every minute he played With Kawhi Leonard and Paul George he s going to have to play some more complementary basketball The big concern in that regard would be whether Williams can be as effective without the ball in his hands As a pure three point shooter and spacer he s good but not any great shakes last year for his career Where Williams truly thrives is attacking the basket He averaged free throw attempts per game hitting at the stripe If he s functioning more as a third option that number would presumably go down Taking the ball out of Williams hands may also highlight his issues on defense Last season he graded as an atrocious defender on RPM He made up with that with his offense but if his offensive is more limited that may be problematic buying high on superstars After helping to bring a title to Toronto Kawhi Leonard s stock and reputation may be at an all time high Right now a huge percentage of community members here consider him the best player in the entire NBA He may indeed be that when he s healthy Unfortunately the when healthy is an important caveat Leonard s durability concerns date back further than his load management this year and his prior injury in San Antonio Through the course of his NBA career Leonard has played in of his regular season games a pace that projects to games played per year Even prior to his big Zaza Pachulia injury he only played of his games of his seasons Going forward it will be interesting to see how much the Clippers can afford to manage his minutes and games in the West Given their long term commitment to Leonard and their loss of picks they would be wise to be prudent there Projecting Leonard to play about games this regular season feels like a fair over under in that regard Meanwhile Leonard s new partner in crime Paul George is also coming off a highwater mark this past year in terms of his public value With George I m less concerned with his durability or shoulder issues he s played in each of the last four seasons However I m slightly concerned that we may be judging him based on a career year This season Paul George averaged points per game Prior to that his career high was only This season he finished rd in MVP voting Prior to that he only cracked the MVP ballot one time finishing th in Now there are a few explanations for Paul George s career year that may depend on the eye of the beholder If you re an optimist you d suggest that he s fully recovered from his broken leg and firmly in his prime If you re a pessimist you may argue that George simply got hotter than he ever has before especially in the beginning of the year and may have benefited from Russell Westbrook s madcap attacking passing ability As always the truth is usually somewhere in between I expect George to be a great player again but counting on him to have a top season would be generous In an average year he s probably a nd team All NBA player overall expectations There are a thousand other factors that go into a win total projection that we don t have time to dig into And some of those aren t negative at all For example the fact that Lou Williams can carry an offense on his own when given the opportunity actually provides the Clippers a nice safety net in the event that Kawhi Leonard or Paul George misses time Given that the Clippers floor is still quite high Even if you expect some missed time and some shooting regression this team should easily win games Overall I would pencil in wins for this Clippers team That s higher than some other advanced sites FiveThirtyEight has them at but lower than most fans may suggest at the moment However the Clippers fans should get excited when the lights come on and playoff mode gets activated With extra rest between games Kawhi Leonard should be more effective than ever and potentially push this team over the top and to the title That said I would not label this a super team that s going to walk to that title There are a bunch of very good teams in the league particularly out West that will have a puncher s chance to win it all themselves and aren t far behind at all The Clippers may still be at the top of that pack but it s going to be a dog fight all the way through ,t3_ca94vt

National TV Schedule Predictions for Major Dates, Note This is not necessarily what I would like for the schedule to be but it is a prediction for what the schedule makers will choose Opening Week TUESDAY ET Los Angeles Clippers Toronto Raptors TNT ET Los Angeles Lakers Golden State Warriors TNT Explanation Toronto obviously will open up on Tuesday night to raise their banner and the only opponent the makes sense here is the Clippers so Kawhi can be with his old teammates to recieve his ring and see the banner go up He would get a huge ovation and it would also make for an entertaining game to see the debut of the PG Kawhi Clippers and the Raptors who are still looking to be competitive The Lakers then would play Golden State in the second game to open up the Lebron AD era at the brand new Chase Center in San Francisco WEDNESDAY ET Dallas Mavericks New Orleans Pelicans ESPN ET Utah Jazz Denver Nuggets ESPN Explanation The Luka Porzingis era in Dallas and the Zion era for New Orleans would begin against each other in Zion s home debut Two of the most exciting young cores who might become powerhouses a few years down the line would be a great way to kick off NBA on ESPN After this Denver and Utah would be a good matchup to start the season off with as they are both less talked about contenders in the West who could build a potential rivalry in the coming years It would also be Mike Conley and Bojan Bogdanovic s debut as a member of the Jazz THURSDAY ET Philadelphia ers Milwaukee Bucks TNT ET Houston Rockets Los Angeles Lakers TNT Explanation Philadelphia and Milwaukee are most likely going to be in the ECF next year and this matchup also has some great storylines such as the battle for the best player in the East For the second game the Lakers would have their home opener against Houston in a battle of two of the top Western Conference teams These matchups last year were always must see TV FRIDAY ET Miami Heat Brooklyn Nets ESPN ET Golden State Warriors Portland Trail Blazers ESPN Explanation The first game of the doubleheader would be the debut of Jimmy Butler and potentially Russell Westbrook as a member of Miami along with Kyrie s debut in Brooklyn Two pretty evenly matched teams would make for some great basketball to open the Friday After Portland would have their home opener in a rematch of the WCF against the Warriors Christmas Day ET New Orleans Pelicans New York Knicks ESPN ET Brooklyn Nets Boston Celtics ABC ET Milwaukee Bucks Philadelphia ers ABC ET Los Angeles Clippers Los Angeles Lakers ABC ESPN ET Houston Rockets Golden State Warriors ESPN Explanation Since it seems like tradition for the Knicks to host a Christmas Day game even if they don t deserve it a perfect matchup would be against New Orleans for the Zion vs RJ storyline To kick off the ABC tripleheader thr much anticipated return of Kyrie s return to Boston would be played This would be an intense game with heavy boos from the Boston crowd along with the storyline of the best PG in the East Kyrie vs Kemba For the second game of the ABC tripleheader the two top Eastern Conference contenders would play in Philly The storylines of this matchup would make a great Christmas game just like the opening Thursday and this time the game would be in Philly Then at primetime the game that would probably become the most watched game of the year would be the battle of LA Paul George and Kawhi Leonard vs LeBron James and Anthony Davis This is a no brainer IMO And to end the night a rematch of nd round matchup and the WCF between Houston and Golden State would be played in San Francisco I really wanted to work Denver vs Portland into this but it seems inevitable New York gets a game so I pushed Denver vs Portland out Martin Luther King Jr Day ET Boston Celtics New York Knicks NBATV ET Dallas Mavericks Atlanta Hawks NBATV ET Utah Jazz Memphis Grizzlies TNT ET Golden State Warriors Philadelphia ers TNT ET Milwaukee Bucks Los Angeles Lakers TNT Explanation This was the same format for last year s MLK Day so I assume it will be the same this year At the Knicks hosted OKC last year but a better matchup this year would be the Kemba led Celtics as Boston vs New York is a good rivalry in many sports and would be a solid way to start off the day Then as it is a tradition in Atlanta to host an MLK Day game because of the history there a good opponent would be the Luka led Mavs because of the Luka Trae storylines along with both teams having two of the best young cores in the league Then to start off the TNT tripleheader as always the first game would be held in Memphis An added storyline to this game would be Mike Conley s return to Memphis as a member of Utah along with it being a matchup of the past vs the future between Conley and Morant Then at primetime Golden State would visit Philly as it seems like Philly always gets an MLK Day game Last year it was Houston vs Philly this year it would be Golden State Then to finish the night Giannis vs LeBron would be the main storyline as the Bucks would visit Staples Center to play the Lakers What changes would you guys want ,t3_cad25f

The biggest lesson from this NBA offseason: Tampering is worth it.,Both the Lakers and Clippers got fined for tampering this past year The lakers with AD and the Clippers with Kawhi The lakers clearly had connections with Klutch which helped facilitate the AD trade and scaring away other potential suitors The Clippers sent reps to Kawhis games tried buying his Nike logo and much more Both teams were fined but both teams ended up with top players in the end Tampering might be frowned upon and the nba tries to discourage it with fines but what s K to an nba franchise trying to win a championship Tampering is worth it and it s probably here to stay ,t3_cad20x

The biggest red flag for each LA team., Lakers Defense This team shouldn t have much trouble to score but defensively Danny Green Caruso AD are the only good great defenders Lebron can hold his own in the playoffs and Cousins is good against other bigs but they have limitations against quicker players Lebron s age mileage Lebron has more help but the responsibility of running the offense will be on him come playoff time and if Lebron s mileage catches up with him this team is done Clippers Point Guard Forward Who is playing point guard forward for this team I m assuming it will be Kawhi PG with Lou Pat handling secondary ball handling Kawhi can make the simple passes but most of his effectiveness as a passer come from penetrating and forcing the defense to help than pin point passes like Chris Paul or Draymond Kawhi will be playing games so it will be interesting to see how PG Lou Pat do in his absence Come playoff time Kawhi PG Lou will be the ones with the ball looking to score first and pass if help comes Bigs The league went smaller the past years because of what Golden State was able to do Bigs are still important and especially during the regular season Come playoff time Zubac and Montrez will have to defend and keep these guys off the glass Jokic Millsap Nurkic Whiteside AD Cousins Looney WCS an underrated pair Gobert and possibly Horford Embiid yikes Philly is definitely a nightmare matchup for this Clippers team TLDR The Championship is still pretty open this year although if The Clippers make a trade for a big that could change things ,t3_caatjv

What rookie do you think will end up being the biggest bust?,In my opinion Darius Garland was a really bad pick I think this kid has potential to be one of the worst picks we ve seen in the past few years Undersized poor defender and at PG but has virtually no playmaking ability The fact that he had more turnovers than assists in college is concerning Granted it was only games but still a bad sign especially on a team like Vanderbilt who has easier competition compared to most top prospects He played games and showed that besides shooting s he can t do literally anything else at a high level He then had a season ending injury and somehow this rose his stock until he was picked th This dude doesn t really seem to have any strengths but shooting which probably won t be as strong in the NBA when he s so small His ceiling imo is a bench guy who can come in and be an okay spark with his shooting His lack of size playmaking and finishing will keep him from ever being a legit NBA starter Obviously I m no professional scout but I really was confused by this pick Anyone agree with this Who do you think from this draft class will be the biggest bust Obviously not everyone pans out but I think Garland was a huge mistake at ,t3_cacxbx

"[Opinion] The reason OKC never worked out was never because of Team Chemistry or ""Choking"", it was because Scott Brooks and Billy Donovan are Bad Coaches",OKC proves the importance of good coaching If OKC had a coach like Casey Stevens Spolestra they d be made much better and would have made Westbrook to have been much more efficient in an actual system of basketball both with KD and with Paul George The incompetency and horrible basketball schemes of Brooks and Donovan that allowed Westbrook to go largely unchecked with very disjointed offensive sets is why OKC has consistently fallen short on their potential The blame rests mostly with the failure to hire competent Head Coaches ,t3_c9x1s5

OKC - Miami trade is actually more possible than it seems,One thing I ve been seeing a lot is that trading Westbrook to Miami would be hard because the Heat can t trade any firsts until That s true but it s because of the pick that is now owed to the Thunder The protections are unprotected Because it could convey in any of those years those picks can t be traded and pick can t be traded because of the Stepien rule So if Miami unprotects that pick it would open up those later picks So something along the lines of Miami receives Westbrook OKC receives Dragic Johnson Herro unprotect st st unprotected Miami gives up one additional pick but it also gives them the ability to trade the st if some other deal comes around in the next few years or they can also now do pick swaps for and if the right deal comes up They could do Waiters instead of Johnson but because of the point shooting I think he probably fits best with Westbrook and Butler For the Thunder Goran is expiring so that s good Johnson has two years Thunder were interested in Herro but he shot up draft boards The is more valuable and they get the st They still have to much salary but Gallo should be movable ,t3_ca8yat

It's the offseason. Here is my top 100 player list.,It s the offseason so I put together my top list for the upcoming season When ranking players I asked myself the question Which player will provide more value towards winning in the upcoming season I try to evaluate guys evenly between value in a vacuum and value when playing w aggregate talent What I mean by that is Zach LaVine has a far better chance to lead a shitty team to wins than Gary Harris because of his ability to create off the dribble himself and conversely Harris is probably a much easier fit schematically with other talented players on a team like Denver because he defends moves and shoots the ball extremely well I wouldn t consider one substantially better than the other I also like to assume relative health with players that have injury history I asked myself how many games I would optimistically guess each player would play and then adjusted their value accordingly So for most injuries were not factored in unless they are starting the season with a serious injury If at this point you don t think it is truly sad how serious I took making a subjective list to post on the internet on my Sunday morning then I don t know what to say Also I left rookies off because they haven t played in any games Notable Omissions Kevin Durant Klay Thompson Victor Oladipo Jusuf Nurkic John Wall Tier Kawhi Leonard LeBron James Steph Curry Giannis Antetokounmpo James Harden Tier Anthony Davis Joel Embiid Tier Nikola Jokic Damian Lillard Paul George Tier Kyrie Irving Jimmy Butler Rudy Gobert Tier Kemba Walker Bradley Beal Russell Westbrook Karl Anthony Towns Blake Griffin Tier Mike Conley Ben Simmons Al Horford Luka Doncic Kristaps Porzingis LaMarcus Aldridge Kyle Lowry Chris Paul Pascal Siakam Draymond Green Tier McCollum Jrue Holiday Khris Middleton DeMar DeRozan Donovan Mitchell De Aaron Fox Trae Young Paul Millsap Devin Booker Nikola Vucevic Tobias Harris Marc Gasol Tier Jayson Tatum Danilo Gallinari D Angelo Russell Myles Turner Buddy Hield Clint Capela Steven Adams Gary Harris Zach LaVine Eric Bledsoe Tier Kevin Love Jamal Murray Malcolm Brogdon Lou Williams Jaren Jackson Jr Brook Lopez Montrezl Harrell Jaylen Brown Bojan Bogdanovic Aaron Gordon Robert Covington Joe Ingles Andre Drummond PJ Tucker Spencer Dinwiddie Lauri Markkanen Domantas Sabonis Brandon Ingram Gordon Hayward Fred VanVleet John Collins Tier Patrick Beverley Eric Gordon Julius Randle Josh Richardson Derrick Favors Marcus Smart Jarrett Allen Malik Beasley Jerami Grant Redick Derrick White ThaddeusYoung Jonas Valanciunas Otto Porter Jr Caris LeVert Derrick Rose Will Barton TJ Warren Shai Gilgeous Alexander DeAndre Ayton Joe Harris Justise Winslow Harrison Barnes Andre Iguodala Rudy Gay Serge Ibaka Nicolas Batum Kyle Kuzma Marcus Morris Sr ,t3_ca7uym
Unpopular Opinion: Players having 100% of the power is not a good thing.,I know that sportsball fans and especially NBA fans worship these athletes and treat them as if they re Gods but logically explain to me how it s good for the fans you know the people who support the league for players under long term contracts to be forcing their way out and then going to join large market teams who were blatantly tampering and trying to recruit their opponent s stars Does this seriously all just boil down to it s their life they should be able to work where they want This is a pro sports league not your shitty office job where it s no big deal if you decide to up and leave on everyone So I guess good luck to any small market teams trying to keep your stars Even if you build your team through the draft any star players you develop will just be stolen by other teams Where Amazing Happens ,t3_ca0krw

"For your consideration, the Ultramax: a Supermax replacement to help small-market teams keep their homegrown superstars",Shamelessly lifted from a comment I left in another thread about the Supermax because I was curious to hear more peoples thoughts on it I present to you the outline for an Ultramax credit u ElDuderino for the name I like the idea of making an Ultramax contract that is of unlimited value and doesn t count against the salary cap at all but only if it is offered to a player that you drafted and has been on your team for x amount of years possibly until the end of their first non rookie contract but that is sometimes too late for trying to keep star players Basically if this were a reality then small market teams would be given a literal blank check to keep their homegrown superstars as they are the only team that would actually be able to offer their stars market value as every true superstar in the league is still underpaid compared to their value on and off the court The simple adjustment to the cap would be to lower it the amount of a full max slot because if they didn t larger market teams or teams with richer owners would theoretically have an advantage over small market teams This system would also reveal which teams are truly interested in winning and which teams are significantly tighter with their pockets and would allow the fans to see who was to blame if their superstar player wants out of town Because it would potentially put NBA owners under fire and would force them to spend more money don t ever really count on this being a reality but it s a nice dream ,t3_ca8jy6

"Minimum contract exception only allows for 1-2 years on it, if its any longer, the team likely used part of the MLE on it", nd Round picks and UDFA have no exceptions attached to them which is why it is extremely common for them to get year deals across the league However if a team wants the player to have full bird rights at the end of their first contract which allows them to go over the cap up to their maximum then they will need to use part of the MLE to get them up to years of contract length As far as I can tell going back in time in contract history is hard it appears that Morey was the pioneer of using this,t3_ca9ft6
The Lakers have managed to dramatically improve the biggest weakness of their team last year: Catch and shoot 3's. Last year they finished dead last in the league with a 33.5% on catch and shoot 3's.

[OC] The salary and roster ramifications of the Raptors pulling the trigger on the reported Westbrook + Paul George deal,The Toronto Raptors are a taxpaying team which means that they can only acquire of the outgoing salary plus $ in a trade Russell Westbrook s salary for the season $ Paul George s salary for the season $ Total $ This means that $ must be sent out by the Raptors in order to match salary We know that Siakam and future unprotected firsts had to be included in the trade Siakam earns $ in the coming season which brings the total additional salary necessary to $ Some possible combinations to match salaries are Lowry Ibaka Siakam Lowry Powell FVV Siakam Gasol Ibaka Powell Siakam Gasol Ibaka FVV Siakam Gasol Ibaka OG Anunoby Siakam Gasol Lowry Siakam In my opinion the most sensible trade from a roster balance perspective is where the Raptors send Lowry Ibaka Siakam future unprotected firsts for Westbrook and Paul George Assuming Kawhi and Danny Green stay in Toronto and they still sign Stanley Johnson the Raptors depth chart now looks like PG Westbrook FVV SG Green Powell SF Paul George OG PF Kawhi Leonard Johnson C Gasol Total salary $ This put their total salary $ above the luxury tax threshold of $ This would result in a tax bill of $ and a total wage bill of $ for the season Note that here I have assumed that Danny Green and Stanley Johnson sign for the same amount they received in reality Without bringing back Danny Green the total salary becomes $ the tax bill becomes $ and the total wage bill becomes $ ,t3_caa0kp

"[Serious] Supermax should obviously have a percentage deducted from the cap, but should the net % be &gt;=&lt; 30% (normal max)",The supermax is a nice concept but flawed and obviously that s not an unpopular opinion One of the solutions that I agree with is taking some of the money off the books that way both sides win Without further ado here s a pros cons list of adjusting the super max gt Pros Gives a discount to a degree while also compensating teams who don t have supermax eligible players Cons probably won t fix the issue of handicapping small market teams Pros Small markets remain competitive and rewards loyalty A good balance Cons FA is a no brainer in terms of money Leaving personal issues like Kawhi and Butler to be the only deciding factor if a player wants to choose since team can offer more money with the same penalty lt Pros Possibly more parity because small market teams can develop superstars keep them and still have less on the cap than big market attractions Bottom Dwellers can now if they develop players build teams easier since they can keep their stars like Booker and also fill out their roster with the extra cap space Cons Anyone that s eligible will want the max knowing that it s less penalty Owners will most likely be paying a lot more than normal as well since super maxes will become a thing Not realistic at all The small sample size of players Curry Wall Harden WB Dame has successes and disasters but what s interesting is the larger market Houston and GS are fine but the smaller markets are not Probably coincidence because curry and harden are just that good and WB is only a concern because of how they overpayed everyone else on OKC but Wizards are crippled and everyone expects Portland to be too and these teams don t have allure like golden state and Houston do does Houston have allure So the main question is to what extent should there be cap removal on supermaxes ,t3_cacy1y

Kawhi is the luckiest man on the planet,I respect the hell out of kawhis game but I ve been following his career and I ve realized he s been extremely extremely fortunate throughout his basketball career Goes through college and is good but not legendary or anything Butttt he gets drafted by a phenomenal spurs team that excels in development and coaching and turns into a much better player because of it Wins a championship with the spurs and wins finals MVP which while deserved was probably the weakest finals mvp performance in the last years maybe iggy was worse He gets into a feud with the spurs org over injuries This is very controversial so I won t get too into it but he forced his way out of the team that ultimately built him and got traded with his pal Danny to another VERY good team that literally did everything they could to make him comfortable He plays lights out in the eastern conference playoffs but gets lucky as HELL in the finals with the warriors losing pretty much their whole roster to injury People will say a ring is a ring injuries always happen But the injuries are extra significant because knowing now that kawhi was gonna leave after one year if he had pulled off this Clippers PG shit without winning the raptors a championship he d be viewed as weak and a complete snake And had warriors had KD for even one entire game I don t think kawhi wins that ring He s obviously a phenomenal player but hot damn he could easily have one less ring two less FMVPs and be one of the most disliked players in the league Rant over ,t3_ca2yid

The story of Magic Johnson showing up at the local Y and crushing the most arrogant pickup team in LA,Note This isn t my story I was reading through old threads on here of guys playing pickup with pros and feel this story perfectly illustrates the gap in talent between us and them The story has been edited for clarity Credit goes to u toldyaso I used to have a membership at the Hollywood YMCA and there as a pickup game there every single day The normal game was just a bunch of guys who were there every day but once or twice a week some crazy good ex college and sometimes even ex pros came in one of them played for UCLA back in the day and one of them had played pro in Europe You had man teams that played to points the winning team kept the court and the next team rotated in When the really good guys came they always played on the same team and ran the court for hours at a time they were dicks about it too acting like they owned the place There was this really old man or so who played a lot He wasn t worth much but he could bomb threes like mad when he was hot and he always claimed that he was friends with Magic Johnson that one day he d bring him in and we d finally get to beat this one really good group of guys We all thought he was full of shit Then one day the group of really good guys came in and started winning and they started ordering everyone around calling cheap fouls etc So this old man lost it he leaves and says he ll be back in twenty minutes Twenty minutes later he came back with lo and behold Magic Johnson This was probably the summer of so Magic was a year removed from his comeback season with the Lakers He was in really good shape and he looked like he was about feet tall compared to me and I m So Magic and this old man formed a team I tried to get on it but they needed runners and I was a known gunner Eventually it s their turn and they take the court Magic played PG dribbled the ball up the court and said he would only shoot the ball two times per game the first bucket of the game and the last The other team just scoffed and said he could shoot all he wanted they were obviously not scared at all Long story short Magic absolutely destroyed the team and made those guys look like little boys As he stated he did indeed score the first bucket of the game which was a very long three pointer it only counted as that s how we played and then he strictly became a passer It seemed like he grabbed just about every rebound of the entire game and made some insane passes At one point he actually dribbled the ball up the court by running backwards and was laughing obviously not even trying at all The old man who called him there ended up hitting a three to make the score or maybe I can t recall but then Magic said Ok you guys get one more posession then this game is over with this big grin on his face So the other team took the ball up the court but all of a sudden like a bolt of lightning or something Magic just it was almost like he disappeared that s how fast he moved he just exploded off his feet stole the ball from the dribbler dribbled the ball up the court like a sprinting deer took it all the way to the hole and dunked it Not a hard dunk not a spectacular dunk it was more like he dunked it the way a normal person would open their car door like his facial expression didn t even change Game over Epilogue The other guys were mad and demanded a rematch but Magic said the rules of the court were that they had to give up the court to the winnig team and wait their turn to play again Magic ended up playing there that day for about hours and won at least games in that timespan The really good team played his team more times and again Magic s team won both times The score was never even close ,t3_cajb53

[OC] Checking the receipts at the 99 cent store: did our suggested purchases actually turn out to be bargains?,A few weeks ago I glanced ahead into free agency and highlighted some potential bargain free agents at the cent store Of course those free agents didn t have an actual price tag attached at the time Now a majority of those players have signed their deals so I thought it may be appropriate to go back and see whether they turned out to be actual bargains or not cent store purchases PG Shake Milton re signed with Philadelphia the contract years terms undisclosed still a bargain Philadelphia didn t disclose the exact figures on this deal but presumably it s for a modest price And as a result the Sixers may have gotten themselves a long term steal Shake Milton isn t a traditional point guard but he can shoot the lights out and has a big frame with wingspan that can capably blend in on defense The Sixers have a phenomenal starting but their lingering concerns will be about shooting and depth If the team can get some extra juice off the bench from second year guards Zhaire Smith and Milton then their upside may be unlimited SG Seth Curry signed with Dallas the contract years $ M per year still a bargain In terms of the salary $ M Seth Curry should still represent fair value Like Shake Milton he s less of a traditional point guard and more of a spacer but Luka Doncic will be handling the lion s share of those playmaking responsibilities anyway And as a complementary shooter Seth Curry excels career beyond the arc If there s any concern here it s the length of the deal Curry is already turning in August so years is a riskier proposition than expected In theory his skill set should age well but he s had some durability concerns in the past including a broken leg in his last stop in Dallas The Mavs need Curry to be fit and healthy for minutes a night to merit this number if he can do that he should represent a good signing PG Delon Wright signed with Dallas the contract years $ per year still a bargain The Mavericks doubled up at the store with a coupon but that doesn t mean they doubled up in terms of duplicating skill sets Delon Wright and Seth Curry represent very different types of guards Curry is a great shooter whereas Wright is an average one who contributes in different ways He s a tall switchable defender and he also has underrated slashing scoring and point guard instincts Both project to be good fits as non traditional guards who defer to Luka Doncic Is the price right here At nearly $ M it sounds about a fair value Wright s free agent prospects were dulled slightly by the fact that he s already but this year deal will keep him during his prime years It may not be a steal contract but it s a solid one SF Reggie Bullock signed with the Knicks the contract years $ per year still a bargain In the cent store entries I labeled featured items like Reggie Bullock as expecting a $ M salary so the Knicks slightly overstepped our budget here by $ here Still I like this deal for them Bullock is a good shooter with enough size at to play either SG or SF To me his $ price tag still represents a slight value if only by $ M While the Knicks got a lot of criticism for their moves this offseason signing shooters like Reggie Bullock and Wayne Ellington makes sense The key to the Knicks going forward will be Barrett He s an attacker who needs proper spacing to truly unlock his full potential If Barrett has a great rookie year then Knicks fans can keep their hopes up for the future If he struggles with his efficiency then we may hear a lot more grumbling about this front office SF Darius Miller re signed with New Orleans the contract years $ per year still a bargain Darius Miller shared a cent entry with Reggie Bullock and they ended up sharing similar fates Like Bullock Miller s primary value is his ability to space the court And like Bullock Miller was signed to help provide extra spacing for a prized rookie Zion Williamson At a healthy $ M a year it s hard to argue that Darius Miller is a steal on the open market It s a fair contract about what he should be worth given his talent level but limited track record Still you like this deal better given the overall fit of the situation here in New Orleans Top exec David Griffin knows that this roster of run and gun young ins needed shooting around them so he re signed Miller and added Redick Neither may be around by the time the team maxes out their potential down the road but they should provide an immediate boost to the chances of a playoff trip either this year or next Sometimes young players can develop bad habits if they are playing on terrible teams but these Pelicans should be ready to scrap for wins right away and the veteran shooters will play a major role in that PF Noah Vonleh signed with Minnesota the contract year $ still a bargain Simple answer hell yes As detailed in the full entry Noah Vonleh still has a lot of upside left in the tank at age His offense may never develop into anything more than serviceable but he is long and light on his feet He has the potential to be one of the better defenders at the PF position if he continues to develop That skill alone makes him an ideal fit next to Karl Anthony Towns who is incredible on offense but mediocre on D It s amazing to me that a team didn t make a bigger investment in Vonleh especially after he played fairly well in New York last year Fortunately for the T Wolves the league s loss is their gain If there s anything to criticize here is that it s only a year deal If Vonleh outplays his contract again he may be in line for a proper pay rise Then again we said that last year C Nerlens Noel re signed Oklahoma City the contract year $ still a bargain Unlike the Noah Vonleh situation we know why teams have shied away from Nerlens Noel Apparently he s too much of a handful for coaches to deal with and execs don t want to put them through that agony Well coaches Suck it up Get coaching Because Nerlens Noel still has a world of upside on the defensive end As mentioned in the entry he is the only player in NBA history yes in recorded history to average over steals and blocks per minutes since that stats have been made official He is supernaturally quick with his feet and hands like Bruce Lee if he was and kind of an asshole To be fair Noel is a zero on offense but his disruptive ability and switchability on defense should merit a contract in the $ M range easily Does Noel fit into OKC s long term plans It s difficult to tell right now because we re not exactly sure what those may be If they want to keep Russell Westbrook and soldier ahead with a playoff push then they still need to consider flipping Steven Adams for more shooting and handing the reins to Noel down low And if they blow it up and go for a full rebuild Noel still isn t a bad fit in that regard either still on the shelves PG Tyus Jones MIN As a restricted free agent Jones market had been slow to develop In fact I missed the fact that he signed a year $ M per year offer sheet with Memphis until it was pointed out by u quitnus That s a fair number and one that I would encourage the T Wolves to match With Jeff Teague expiring after this year they need a long term safety net at PG more than Memphis does PF Trey Lyles DEN Also a restricted free agent the Nuggets may decide to bring him back as insurance in case Michael Porter Jr can t make it through a season SF Theo Pinson BKN One of my favorite underrated entries Pinson was a restricted free agent but was recently released into the wild by the Nets He could prove to be a steal addition for teams that value his playmaking defense and think his improved shooting may be for real SF Justin Holiday MEM Despite some decent ability as a D wing Holiday has yet to sign He could still end up being a bargain rotational player PF Christian Wood NO The Pelicans haven t made a decision regarding the G League standout but their frontcourt is getting awfully crowded He may be on the move after all C Khem Birch ORL Another RFA another man in limbo C Kosta Koufos and C Tyler Zeller I included both of these veteran big men as potential depth plays at center but they may have to wait to see how rosters shake up before determining whether they get a spot or not PG Shane Larkin n a Similarly we haven t heard a lot about the idea of Larkin coming over to the States but he was a fringe inclusion who will be on the borderline for a roster spot himself More likely he ll stay with a featured role in Europe ,t3_cakpne

Are We Underrating DeMarcus Cousins?,Hi everyone DeMarcus Cousins recently committed to a year contract with the Lakers worth $ million The market for his services has collapsed due in part to his recent injury troubles his reputation as being a difficult player to reel in and the game shifting away from traditional immobile big men That all being said his recent appearance in the Finals on the heels of a torn quad seems to have colored r nba s view of Cousins and his potential for the upcoming NBA season amp nbsp Going into next season Cousins is expected to be completely healed from both his achilles and quad injuries and should be coming in at or as close as he can be after the severity of his achilles injury What can we expect for Cousins on the court Let s look at his regular season performance last season for the Warriors as being a reasonable projection for him amp nbsp MP on TS PER amp nbsp Not awe inspiring but better than expected while rehabbing from a torn achilles Let s look closer to see whether his numbers improved as he got back into game shape amp nbsp First games MP on TS ORtg DRtg Last games MP on TS ORtg DRtg amp nbsp These are not massive sample sizes but appear to show a positive trend in Boogie s performance leading up to his quad injury Still there are two larger questions Will Boogie return to pre achilles injury form and will he be a defensive liability amp nbsp The consensus on r nba is that Boogie looked like a shell of himself this past season The numbers suggest that he was approaching pre injury level performance last season amp nbsp Per Poss on TS Per Poss on TS amp nbsp Most notably Boogie s decline in TS actually came from a regression at the PT line while his P rose from to Boogie actually put up career best numbers in shots inside of feet which is where you would expect an athletic regression to show Boogie also committed TO Poss in the season and this dropped to TO Poss in the season The numbers show that Boogie actually improved in several areas after coming back from his achilles injury including defense amp nbsp Per Poss Stl Blk FG allowed at rim Per Poss Stl Blk FG allowed at rim amp nbsp Allowing FG at the rim is very respectable and was actually slightly better than Al Horford s performance this year Boogie also recorded career highs in Stl and Blk amp nbsp I also thought it was interesting that Cousins showed very well towards the end of the season against Nikola Jokic and Clint Capela in particular two potential matchups in next year s playoffs amp nbsp vs Rockets Cousins vs Capela vs Nuggets Cousins vs Jokic amp nbsp Was Boogie at last season coming off an achilles injury No but he was a lot closer than people are claiming He dropped off a cliff in the Finals because he was coming off of a torn quad injury and that is the last impression we were all left with This would happen to any player in his situation We should be analyzing Boogie based on his regular season numbers which present a more likely approximation of the player he will be next season The reality is that we could definitely see Boogie at the height of his powers next season and the data suggests that we are more likely to see that Boogie than the washed up version that we saw a month ago Even if Boogie doesn t improve over last season s regular season performance he is being very undervalued ,t3_caht2o

RJ Barrett has followed up his subpar summer league debut by going 2-12 from the field for a total of 6 points,In his debut he was from the field for points RJ so far hasn t done much to silence the critics who said he was an inefficient ball hog has just one assist in each summer league game He should be shooting much better playing against replacement level NBA talent I expect him to refine his game however once he starts working with the Knicks coaches He s had tunnel vision though EDIT He also has turnovers,t3_cafs5f

The CBA that owners pushed for is responsible for the tampering/trade demand culture,Some Redditors may not be old enough to remember but back in the day when your rookie contract was over you could sign where ever you want Shaq went to the Lakers McGrady went to the Magic Grant Hill went to the Magic Tim Duncan stayed with the Spurs Players didn t demand trades because they felt like rookie contracts were reasonable They could decide where to continue their careers once those contracts were up If teams like the Spurs did a good job building a contender players were likely to stay If they weren t like Hill they were likely to leave And sometimes slighting a player by low balling him sent him to another team like Shaq None of those guys demanded a trade and their teams were free to trade them during the seasons ahead of free agency But then teams wanted control over players careers for longer periods They wanted the restricted free agency for rookies They wanted teams to be able to retain their own players by being able to offer bigger contracts Then players had to leave money on the table if they wanted to play somewhere else What happens Surprise They sign their contracts and then ask for a trade As we ve seen with AD and PG and even with Melo when Denver traded him teams can get a huge haul and jump start a re build if have failed to build around a player over the course of their rookie contract If teams weren t so eager to assert control over player for longer durations of their careers players wouldn t be kicking back so hard This is not players being dicks it s players kicking back from a thumb being pressed on their backs This current climate sucks Yeah It s confusing and it seems unfair but it is a symptom of a bigger problem Big markets will always have an advantage and that s just the way it is It sucks But teams like Detroit and Dallas and San Antonio and Toronto have proven that you don t have to be LA or NY to build a champion Hell the Warriors were NOT a free agent destination until they started drafting well And Boston draws free agents despite not being a media mecca like NY and LA And Chi town is the third largest market in the country and can t sign players worth shit Teams owners governors need to take ownership over their respective inabilities to build teams and accept that fact that markets like LA and NY will always have an advantage and that they have to work with and around that ,t3_cag9sy

Would your team take a flier on Andre Roberson?,I think with this Grant move trading him only for a pick is evident that Presti is probably clearing away salary for a Russ Adams trade that results in us having to take equal contracts back Miami Bucks Detroit don t have the cap space to absorb and Miami is hard capped so it d have to match up pretty fantastically Furthermore none of those teams will give us young assets that we ll want to keep in the future we ll probably have to flip guys at the deadline Thinking Waiters Dragic Bledsoe Jackson if we ended up with them So I think Andre is another guy that would help with that With Jerami gone for nothing we just cleared $ m in salary and $ m in tweet details the numbers but seems we re only $ m over the lux tax line gt OKC by trading Jerami Grant to DEN i saves $ M $ M salary plus $ M tax ii drops to just $ M over the tax line to players need to add one more putting itself in striking distance to avoid the repeater tax altogether and iii generates a $ trade exception Any other teams you think could use Robes I know Mavs have some room left to just absorb the contract Or Hawks Or any ther teams with TPEs that would take him ,t3_cam44p

[OC] Generating stats-based historical comparisons for the draft lottery,This post has a few graphs If you don t want to click on each one individually they re all in an imgur album here There is no tl dr for this post but all players are bolded if you re looking for a specific one At the end of each player s summary there s a link to a graph summarizing their top most similar players Introduction As soon as a team selects a player in the draft analysts rush to compare the player to historical players Often analysts draw these comparisons based off play style After matching the play styles analysts compare the prospect to a the best with that play style to give the prospect a ceiling Fast and athletic point guard Let s compare him to Westbrook Rose and Wall Long defender with a currently limited offensive game Kawhi looking at you Chauncey Billups Though this method may be the easiest way for us to equate prospects to legends it has its pitfalls In Kawhi s case he developed a killer isolation game in the NBA something we would have never seen coming at the time of the draft Who would ve thought Blake Griffin a career FT shooter in college would grow to shoot on point attempts this year Players develop their play styles in different and unexpected ways So basing a comparison on an imagined reality where a player refines only his current skills seems odd After all we re comparing them to what the stars became not what they were when they came into the draft Despite these issues though this is often the best way to make comparisons for prospects To solve this issue we can compare their college stats Though comparing players based off similar stats won t be perfectly accurate it does give us some type of concrete metric for comparison We ll even find that many of these comparison players have similar play styles Let s draw comparisons for this year s draft lottery Similarity metrics There are many different metrics for measuring the distance between two sets of numbers or vectors In this post we ll use two metrics cosine similarity and Euclidean distance Cosine similarity is the cosine of the angle that s between two vectors The vectors are cast into n dimensions where n is the number of elements in the vectors This explanation of cosine similarity is not easy to understand Instead let s do an example calculation of cosine similarity Let s find the cosine similarity between the vector and The first step in calculating cosine similarity is taking the dot product of the two vectors or multiplying the first element in each vector and adding it to the product of the second element in each vector The dot product of the two vectors Next we ll divide this dot product by the product of the length of each vector The length of the vector sqrt x^ y^ The length of the first vector sqrt The length of the second vector sqrt Altogether we ll do sqrt sqrt For positive values cosine similarity will be between and a cosine similarity of indicates perfect similarity After doing the above calculations we can see that the cosine similarity for the two vectors is Euclidean distance is much much simpler than cosine similarity It s an extension of the distance formula the distance between x y and x y sqrt x x ^ y y ^ Euclidean distance simply takes this distance formula and extends it for however many data points we have in each vector Unlike cosine similarity it is not bounded by a range A Euclidean distance of indicates perfect similarity Methods First I created a data base of the college advanced and counting stats for every lottery pick in this year s draft For the historical data set I collected college stats for every lottery pick who played in college since The restriction is set at because players drafted in played their entire college careers with a point line All data is from Sports Reference Though the NBA did not always have teams meaning the lottery was not always the top picks I define lottery as the top given that s what it is today Because the data set only includes college players if an overseas player was selected in the top then the th pick is considered in the lottery given that he s among the top NCAA players For these players I ended up using the following stats in the similarity vectors Counting stats Defensive stats Advanced stats G STL TS PTS BLK PAr AST PF FTr TRB WS TOV All the counting and defensive stats were adjusted to be per stats Because we ended up using win shares which is only available for players since the draft we ll only compare this year s lottery to all lotteries since All stats were also standardized to be between and for the purpose of the similarity metrics For each rookie we computed cosine similarity and Euclidean distance to every player in the historical database We then analyzed the top most similar players returned by each metric Inspiration This post is inspired by u kip chelly s post on Reddit a couple years ago He also used cosine similarity to compare draft prospects to previous top picks and stars It is an excellent post that produced some interesting results that we can look back at it s a highly recommended read I ve expanded on his post by adding Euclidean distance and using fewer dimensions stats making for a simpler comparison The only issue with his excellent analysis is that his historical data set included primarily good players so everyone would be compared to stars I ve expanded on this part too by using every lottery player and comparing their college careers instead of individual seasons Results Pick Zion Williamson Far and away the top prospect in the draft Zion Williamson often draws comparisons to Charles Barkley and Blake Griffin He had the lowest Euclidean distance to Kevin Durant and the highest cosine similarity to Shawn Marion Though Marion appears to be an unflattering comparison given Zion s lofty expectations Marion was a x All Star x All NBA player and an NBA champion with the Mavs in Barkley is not included in the database meaning Zion could not be compared to him Surprisingly Blake Griffin was not among Zion s top comparisons Griffin had the th lowest Euclidean distance and only the th highest cosine similarity to Zion Looking at their college stats threes and free throws were likely the biggest difference Blake Griffin s free throw rate was about higher while his point attempt rate was about times lower Zion was the only player to have Anthony Davis in his top most similar players He and Barrett were the only players to return Kevin Durant as one of their most similar players Pick Ja Morant The top point guard in this draft Ja Morant s mix of athleticism and passing ability leads many to compare him to John Wall Indeed Morant was the only player to return John Wall His highest cosine similarity was to Derrick Rose another common comparison Andre Miller who lead the league in assists in just his third year had the lowest Euclidean distance to Ja Morant In this case the statistical comparison matches the typical play style comparison as Morant returned both Wall and Rose Though Miller was not as athletic as Morant he was an excellent distributor This sheds light on Morant s potential as a distributor Pick Barrett A smooth ball handler and mid range shooter Barrett was most similar to Carmelo Anthony in both cosine similarity and Euclidean distance Barrett was the only player to return Melo making the comparison appear even stronger Barrett also returned Markelle Fultz and D Angelo Russell both came out of college as smooth guards with excellent potential to score all over the floor Highlighting his ball handling and transition abilities we found that Barrett was also the only player to return Lamar Odom Pick DeAndre Hunter A defensive stud with excellent amp D potential DeAndre Hunter had the highest cosine similarity to Shane Battier He had the lowest Euclidean distance to Frank Kaminsky Both players had excellent defensive stats on high efficiency in college Surprisingly Hunter was the only player to return Vince Carter Hunter s combination of excellent defense and shooting makes him one of the most NBA ready prospects in the draft Unfortunately this combo leads to some disappointing comparisons Pick Darius Garland The second point guard off the board after Morant Darius Garland has drawn comparisons to Damian Lillard given his range and scoring ability Garland had the highest cosine similarity to Trae Young He had the lowest Euclidean distance to Jamal Crawford Though Garland seems much more athletic than Young the comparison seems fair given the mix of pull up shooting and distribution Pick Jarrett Culver One of the most versatile wings in the draft Jarrett Culver had the highest cosine similarity to McCollum Though he is inches taller and has a inch longer wingspan Culver has shown flashes of McCollum s well rounded guard skill set Culver was the only player to return McCollum Interestingly both of Culver s closest comparisons were guards he had the lowest Euclidean distance to Kemba Walker In addition to returning these two excellent guards Culver was the only player to return Paul Pierce Pick Coby White A true speed demon Coby White had the highest cosine similarity to Stephon Marbury He had the lowest Euclidean distance to Brandon Knight This seems like an excellent comparison given that Marbury also liked to play a fast game Both White and Marbury averaged under assists per game in college It seems the NBA spacing and speed helped Marbury as he average points and assists per game as a rookie Pick Jaxson Hayes Jaxson Hayes was the first true rim protecting big off the board In college he was a quick rim running big making the likes of Clint Capela a natural comparison However unlike Capela or DeAndre Jordan Hayes shot an excellent from the free throw line Hayes had the highest cosine similarity to another player who appeared to be a defensive big but shot well from the free throw line in college Karl Anthony Towns Though Hayes isn t nearly as polished offensively as Towns who showed flashes of being a great passer and mid range shooter was coming out of college the comparison is encouraging He had the lowest Euclidean distance to Zach Collins Further strengthening his potential Hayes was the only player to return Karl Anthony Towns and Joel Embiid Pick Rui Hachimura Rui Hachimura progressed very well while at Gonzaga His freshman year he barely saw the court playing only MPG However this year he scored PPG on high efficiency He has excellent potential as a combo forward However his comparisons are not as noticeable as some of the players before him Interestingly Hachimura was primarily compared to centers Hachimura had the highest cosine similarity to Brendan Haywood Haywood had a year career as an inside center He was a role player for the Mavs in their championship season and was top in the league in blocks in the season Hachimura had the lowest Euclidean distance to Michael Doleac another center He was the only player to return Joakim Noah Pick Cam Reddish Playing alongside Zion Williamson and Barrett Cam Reddish had little opportunity to shine at Duke However he appears to have the potential of a star scorer Reddish had the highest cosine similarity and lowest Euclidean distance to Donovan Mitchell He was the only player to return Mitchell Like Mitchell Reddish may greatly benefit from the spacing and opportunity for him in the NBA Pick Cam Johnson Cam Johnson seemed to be a reach according to many analysts Though he was projected to go in the late first round the Suns took him th overall Nevertheless Johnson has excellent potential to be a productive amp D forward Johnson had the highest cosine similarity and lowest Euclidean distance to Trajan Langdon a prolific shooter from Duke Langdon played in the NBA for seasons before having a great career in Europe Today Langdon is the GM of the Pelicans Johnson was the only player along with DeAndre Hunter to return Shane Battier Pick Washington A great versatile big Washington had the highest cosine similarity and lowest Euclidean distance to Curtis Borchardt Borchardt played for the Jazz for seasons before being traded and then going to play in Europe The draft had players who didn t play in college before Borchardt so he was not actually picked in the lottery but was moved up to lottery status for this analysis However to compare Washington to players picked in the lottery we ll look at the second best comparisons Washington had the second highest cosine similarity to Hasheem Thabeet and the second lowest Euclidean distance to Al Horford Horford seems to be a bast case comparison for Washington in terms of refining his passing and scoring while becoming a great defender Washington was the only player to return Al Horford Pick Tyler Herro One of the best pure shooters in the draft Tyler Herro had the highest cosine similarity to Steph Curry and lowest Euclidean distance to Jeremy Lamb He was the only player to return Curry Though it s clearly unfair to compare Herro to the greatest shooter ever Herro seems to have many of Curry s qualities Herro is an excellent shooter off the dribble an intelligent player off the ball and has a quick release Pick Romeo Langford The final player in the lottery Romeo Langford had the highest cosine similarity and lowest Euclidean distance to Andrew Wiggins Like Wiggins Langford seems to be a smooth slashing wing Unfortunately Langford seems to have a similar demeanor to Wiggins lists Langford s first weakness as doesn t always look fully engaged in the game and intensity level seems to come and go Along with being the only player to return Andrew Wiggins Langford was the only player aside from Ja Morant to return Derrick Rose This is my newest post with my open source basketball analytics blog Dribble Analytics The GitHub for this project is

Should the Lakers Start Anthony Davis at Center?, Impact on Defense Ever since the Demarcus Cousins acquisition I ve seen a lot of people assuming that AD will slide to the with Cousins at the Imo I don t think this would be the best move for the Lakers Although AD can do a good job when switched onto the perimeter he is at his best on defense when protecting the rim Along with Embiid and Gobert he is one of the top rim protectors in the NBA Starting Cousins or Javale would diminish AD s presence in the paint and leave him somewhat susceptible to smaller quicker players he could get switched onto at the In addition Cousins is simply not a good defender anymore whether it is protecting the rim or when switched onto smaller players amp x B Impact on Offense Although both AD and Cousins have games that can be effective from outside and inside they both are at their best when doing damage in the paint By starting both players it forces one to do more damage from outside Although AD would be okay in this situation as he s a great midrange shooter and solid point shooter it does limit his ability to catch lobs and finish at the rim since Cousins will be more comfortable sitting in the paint Cousins outside game has also greatly fallen off a cliff since his days on the Pelicans He shot only and from three in the regular season and playoffs respectively In addition his pick and pop shooting from midrange wasn t as effective as it used to be Although Cousins was easily the superior player to Mirotic I still feel that the Pelicans were at their best when Mirotic played the with AD at the due to the somewhat awkward pairing of AD Cousins That pairing would become a lot more awkward with Cousins a shell of his old self Letting Cousins come off the bench when AD sits would allow him to gradually work himself back to while going against bench units In addition it would allow him to have the have the ball in his hands more and do more damage in the paint similar to how he played for the Kings amp x B Recommendation for Starting Lineup PG Caruso KCP Other FA SG Green SF Lebron PF Kuzma C AD amp x B Edit Let me clarify that whoever is at center in the starting lineup is not super important as some of you mentioned but the lineup I have listed above I think should absolutely be their crunch time lineup ,t3_calzcz

"Anfernee Simons and Gary Trent Jr combined vs Houston in summer league- 47 points, 11/14 from 3, 10 boards and 7 assists.",I ve really been impressed with this duo since last summer league They can definitely get backup minutes and contribute off the bench The franchise was founded in as the Buffalo Braves one of three expansion teams to join the NBA that year The Braves moved from Buffalo New York to San Diego California in and became known as the San Diego Clippers In The Clippers moved to Los Angeles Through much of its history the franchise failed to see significant regular season or playoff success The Clippers were frequently seen as an example of a perennial loser in American professional sports drawing unfavorable comparisons to the historically successful Lakers with whom they have shared a market since and an arena since ,t3_cag8p4
Does Paul George's recent trade request confirm or invalidate the notion that market size and market location still matters to players' title aspirations?,Was thinking about Paul George s trade request last Friday and evaluating it from the perspective of small markets In recent years the conversation about market size and market location has shifted towards people not believing that it matters anymore Russ can build a brand in OKC Dame in Portland Brow in NOLA Moreover it s not about market location see New York Knicks that matters but it s simply about how good the organization is how much they invest in both players and front offices to ensure that they can remain in the playoff picture compete for titles each year see Portland Utah and Indiana as examples of great small market organizations But even if a small market does everything right by the player and invests in coaching medical staffs smart capologists has a great GM ownership largely stays out of the process the reality is that only ONE small market team has ever won multiple titles the Spurs San Antonio s success is also a perfect storm To recap here s what had to happen suffer injuries to two best players president fires head coach and takes over as head coach despite having no NBA head coaching experience somehow win lottery draft pantheon level talent with No overall pick win championship early establish absolute trust between pantheon level player and coach front office still freak out when pantheon level player takes Free Agency meeting with Orlando be thankful that pantheon level player stays in your small market and cements trust with organization draft unknown guards from Europe South America and hope they can be decent players pantheon level player continues to carry franchise and brings another title previously unknown international guards become good great players pantheon level player and guards win two more titles together pantheon level player willingly relinquishes heavy duty lifting of team to guards team remains title contenders draft freakishly large wingspan kid out of college mid major outside the lottery remain title contenders win another title and finally acquire marquee free agent If you look at the Nets or the Clippers there s no doubt that in the last few years the national view of these organizations has changed From being laughingstocks they ve made brilliant moves ownership has empowered smart offices and they ve become attractive destinations But neither the Clippers or the Nets have won anything in their history Meanwhile it took the Spurs winning championships and years of unprecedented success before a premiere free agent Lamarcus Aldridge would say yea that seems like a good team to go to Side Note It also had to have been frustrating for Portland b c a small market lost its best player to another small market As much as we harp on incompetent FOs and interfering owners I m not convinced that market size and market location don t matter San Antonio Portland Utah Indiana Miami though they would fall under the attractive mid size market who also gets a location boost and some others I may be missing have all been brilliantly run franchises for a long time Meanwhile Brooklyn can be bad for a long time the Clippers for almost their entire existence and the Lakers could be awful for the last six years and yet players will still flock there A small market cannot afford such sustained incompetence because then no one would want to play there In the end I m not sure that market size and market location don t matter In fact I d argue they still matter a lot to the best players in the league of the league s best players only Giannis Dame Jokic and Russ though he may be leaving play in small markets And there s already talk of whether or not Giannis will leave if the Bucks can t win though Giannis has said he won t go Who knows what will happen with Jokic in a few years if Denver starts to hit a lull So does market size and market location matter If so how much And if not what would you guys say is the reason that the major markets remain attractive destinations while the small but consistently competitive markets do not ,t3_cal903

The Domino Effect of the James Harden Trade,On October James Harden was traded to the Houston Rockets was traded by the Oklahoma City Thunder A trade that changed NBA History forever Harden and the Thunder were working on a contract extension and instead of giving Harden the deal he wanted the Thunder traded him away because they didn t want to pay an extra five million dollars The Thunder traded away Harden and other filler to the Rockets and in return got Kevin Martin Jeremy Lamb and three draft picks that turned into Steven Adams Alex Abrines and Mitch McGary Adams is the only player from that trade still on the Thunder roster while James Harden has gone on to the lead the Rockets to the postseason seven years in a row win an MVP and been an MVP finalist multiple times He has had multiple trips to the Western Conference Finals and has evolved into one of the best offensive players this league has ever seen The Thunder gave that up because they didn t want to give him five million additional dollars It s been routinely discussed as one of the greatest what ifs of all time for the Thunder but no one really discusses it from a league wide perspective That s what we will break down today We ll talk about the Thunder as well but this trade changed NBA History forever There s a little to more it than Oklahoma City Oklahoma City Thunder The Thunder had already extended Durant Westbrook and Ibaka by the time it came to negotiating Harden s extension These were the reigning Western Conference Champions One would think that that should be kept together but Sam Presti and the front office thought otherwise Since the James Harden trade the Thunder went to the Western Conference Finals twice with Durant Westbrook and Ibaka together but never reached the NBA Finals Imagine if they had all been kept together James Harden would ve been a massive help in the Western Conference Finals when the Thunder had a lead over the win Golden State Warriors The Thunder traded Jeremy Lamb to the Charlotte Hornets for Luke Ridnour and a second round pick Kevin Martin was involved in a three team trade that ended up in the Thunder acquiring Szymon Szewcyk The Thunder ultimately got nothing out of the Harden trade Don t get me wrong Steven Adams is a good player but he s not James Harden and seeing what has happened to the Thunder ever since Kevin Durant left one can t help but imagine what the team would be like had they chose to keep Harden The Thunder traded Serge Ibaka to the Orlando Magic for Ersan Ilyasova Victor Oladipo and Domantas Sabonis right before Kevin Durant left in an attempt to make cap room and prepare for his potential departure He left for the Golden State Warriors and Russell Westbrook was left on his own A team that once had three superstars on it was now down to the worst of the three The Thunder would play the season out and Russell Westbrook made history by becoming the first player since Oscar Robertson to average a triple double over an NBA season Westbrook won the MVP but ultimately the season ended in a first round playoff loss to MVP Finalist James Harden and the Rockets The Thunder realized that if they wanted to compete with the Rockets and Warriors they would need a second star So using the pieces they acquired in the Serge Ibaka trade they sent out Oladipo and Sabonis to the Indiana Pacers for Paul George They also traded Enes Kanter Doug McDermott and a nd round draft pick that turned into Mitchell Robinson to the New York Knicks for Carmelo Anthony All those players that were given up for Anthony would have contributed more to the Thunder than Anthony ever did After two embarrassing first round exit losses in back to back seasons to the Utah Jazz and Portland Trail Blazers Paul George wanted out Possibly regretting re signing with the franchise in he was traded to the Los Angeles Clippers to join Kawhi Leonard to form a title contender for the next few seasons If the Thunder never trade James Harden Kevin Durant might not have left in They would have never acquired Paul George from Indiana or Carmelo Anthony from New York If the Thunder never traded James Harden they could have potentially won an NBA title or even multiple titles However they threw all that away because they didn t want to pay Harden an extra five million dollars Now they re stuck with no Kevin Durant no Paul George and Russell Westbrook on the decline on a supermax contract that ends in They re being forced into a rebuild and until they get off of that contract it s not looking like the Thunder will be in any position to contend for a title anytime soon Houston Rockets If the Thunder had known what James Harden would ve become I m sure they never would have traded him but they did and the Rockets got him for nothing The Rockets were rebuilding after the end of the Tracy McGrady and Yao Ming era and James Harden fell right into their lap courtesy of Sam Presti The Rockets have gone to the postseason all seven years that James Harden has been there That includes two Western Conference Finals appearances that ended in losses to the Golden State Warriors The Warriors acquisition of Kevin Durant in caused the Rockets to get more aggressive in the offseason and acquired Chris Paul from the Los Angeles Clippers for Patrick Beverly Lou Williams Montrezl Harrell and other filler The trade helped the Rockets take the Warriors to Games in the Western Conference Finals in and helped put the Clippers into position for where they are today but we ll talk about that later If the Rockets never acquire Harden they very well could still be rebuilding Knowing Daryl Morey they likely could ve acquired a different star but probably not one on the level of James Harden and they never would have traded for Chris Paul which would have altered the Clippers future Golden State Warriors Kevin Durant left the Thunder for the Warriors after losing to the Warriors in the Western Conference Finals after blowing a lead to them Kevin Durant s arrival in Golden State made them unbeatable The Warriors won back to back titles in and Durant winning Finals MVP in both of those series So what would have the Warriors been had Durant not showed up In the Warriors would have faced the San Antonio Spurs without Kevin Durant but that ultimately wouldn t have mattered because Zaza Pachulia stepped under Kawhi Leonard s ankle effectively ending the series The Warriors would have gone on to play the Cavaliers and without Durant the Cavaliers would have won that series and the Warriors would be in the Finals In Curry missed games and it s entirely possible they could have missed the postseason that year The Warriors went in the games Curry missed and that was with Durant Klay Thompson and Draymond Green In they would have gone to the NBA Finals but lost to Kawhi Leonard and the Raptors becoming in the NBA Finals with their one finals win being tainted by the Cavaliers not being fully healthy If James Harden had never been traded Kevin Durant might not have ever left meaning the Warriors don t win multiple championships and the Cavs reaping the benefits Cleveland Cavaliers Kevin Durant s arrival in Golden State prevented the Cavs from winning more than the one championship that was won in LeBron James left for the Los Angeles Lakers in after carrying an awful Cavs roster to the NBA Finals and getting swept by Durant and the Warriors If Durant never arrives the Cavs would have won back to back championships in Going back to back may have caused Kyrie Irving to not request a trade However since his trade request came from not wanting to be second fiddle to LeBron any longer let s say he still gets traded but this time not to the Boston Celtics but to the Phoenix Suns The Cavs had agreed to a trade in principal before it fell apart with the Phoenix Suns and Indiana Pacers that would have landed Paul George and Eric Bledsoe in Cleveland and Kyrie Irving in Phoenix Suns This time a Cavs roster comprised of James George Love and Bledsoe would have taken on possibly the Oklahoma City Thunder with Durant Westbrook and Harden in the NBA Finals We honestly don t know if that Thunder core would have still been together six years later but it s possible If the Cavs were able to snag Paul George and Bledsoe and then win the NBA Title Maybe LeBron James doesn t leave for LA Maybe he and Paul George both re sign and form a powerful contender in the Eastern Conference to compete with Kawhi Leonard s Raptors Giannis Bucks and Embiid s Sixers Los Angeles Lakers Following the Kyrie Irving trade to the Boston Celtics the Cavs roster was awful LeBron James dragged the Cavs to the finals in James was a free agent and had given Cleveland everything he had He fulfilled his promise of bringing a title back home and owed the city nothing else He left Cleveland and went to Los Angeles After an unsuccessful first year full of drama and speculation The Lakers acquired Anthony Davis in a blockbuster trade from the New Orleans Pelicans and also tried recruiting Kawhi Leonard before he ultimately signed with the Clippers with Paul George But as we discussed above what if LeBron and Paul George were together in Cleveland Does Anthony Davis still request a trade to the Lakers if LeBron isn t there I would imagine he still wants out of New Orleans but do the Lakers feel the need to grab him if they can t Maybe they do and maybe they have Anthony Davis and Kawhi Leonard decides to sign with them instead of the Clippers and the Lakers are the team to beat in the West instead of the Clippers Los Angeles Clippers I m sure you re thinking about Paul George in terms of how the Clippers were affected by the James Harden trade and you re right Paul George is one of the dominoes that fell but there s more to it than that If Durant never joins Golden State do the Clippers feel the need to break up the Big Three of Chris Paul Blake Griffin and Deandre Jordan Worth remembering the trades of Chris Paul and Blake Griffin ultimately landed them Lou Williams Montrezl Harrell Patrick Beverly Landry Shamet and the cap space necessary to land them Kawhi Leonard and the ability to trade for Paul George The Clippers were able to build a title contender off the James Harden trade but if that never happens where are they The Clippers playoff runs were almost always ended in injuries to Chris Paul and Blake Griffin and were never truly able to compete for a title like they should have been able to So maybe they still trade Chris Paul and Blake Griffin Detroit is still likely where Blake Griffin lands but what about Chris Paul James Harden isn t in Houston he s in OKC What team is going to trade for him or do they trade him at all Do they just trade Blake and acquire Tobias Harris from Detroit But that doesn t bring them any closer to a title than before The Clippers are much harder to figure out because everything they have done has been because of James Harden being traded to the Rockets Conclusion Oklahoma City trading James Harden caused Durant to leave for Golden State and win two championships with them It knocked over a series of dominoes that ended up bringing LeBron James and Anthony Davis to the Lakers and Kawhi Leonard and Paul George to the Clippers The Thunder after getting to the NBA Finals with their core of Durant Westbrook Harden and Ibaka threw all of it away because they didn t want to pay Harden an extra five million dollars If they knew what we all know now they would have kept him James Harden may never win a championship but his trade helped a lot of other franchises win championships That is the domino effect of the Harden trade ,t3_cadqj7

"Prediction: Favor for using a ""Top-16 Teams"" playoff format versus the ""Top-8 in East/West"" format will reach an all-time high in 2020",We re going to see a similar teams making the playoffs in the West with the Lakers supplanting one of them which would mean the young fun Sacramento Kings on the outside Luka Kristaps not making it the intriguing young Pelicans KAT and the Wolves a growing young duo in Booker and Ayton All these teams could be way more fun and honestly better than what a lot of the East will have to offer The East will send in the Bucks and ers as the only contenders and only a few others as teams that can to make noise The Nets will probably be pretty good but Kyrie demonstrated he s not to be taken seriously as the guy and won t be legit until KD returns Celtics are always good but I can t see them contending with their front court The Heat wouldn t be surprising as a team that makes a run and are looking way better than last season but they re not honest contenders Pacers always make the playoffs but tend to flame out The Raptors will play with a lot of pride but aren t a dangerous team without Kawhi Anyway now that I typed all this out I m realizing most of y all are going to read this into slights against your team and therefore downvote this so uhhh The End ,t3_cam1h5

What would the league look like today if Lebron played like crap in game 6 of the 2012 Eastern Conference Finals,With today being the year anniversary of The Decision and ESPN reliving some of Lebron s greatest Miami Heat moments I can t help but think of this game Not only was this the turning point of Lebron s career it was also hugely influential for the future of the league If Lebron sucked and the Celtics won game thus going to the Finals I wonder what would have happened Would Spoelstra have been fired Would the big three Heat break up without winning a title The Thunder and Celtics made major trades in and respectively that altered the NBA s landscape throughout the rest of the decade Since one of these teams would have won a title in would those trades have happened The Spurs changed their style of play after losing to the Heat in and came out the next year with a system that inspired the rest of the NBA Would that have happened if there were no big three Heat to lose to in Would the idea of meeting up with your friends on teams with cap space died That would have changed a lot about this offseason Those are just a few thoughts outside my head Maybe I m overthinking it and the league would have still course corrected itself Just an interesting thought experiment ,t3_calo6b

How far does a Russell Westbrook / Jimmy Butler duo realistically go out East?,We tend to overrate these cores when they happen Remember the hype around the T Wolves with KAT Wiggins Butler Teague etc we just saw OKC go to back to back st Round Exits Both of those teams had the guys who d form this duo of course the one difference being they re out East now Are they better than the Nets with Kyrie but no KD Maybe Are they better than the Celtics led by Kemba Tatum Prolly not Are they better than the Bucks led by Giannis Unless Giannis regresses nah Are they better than the ers with their stars Nope So we re talking about competing with the Pacers Nets and mortgaging our future with flexibility for what exactly Maybe a competitive nd Round Exit ,t3_cadv57
So in regards to the rumors of Westbrook and the Heat...,I ve heard of a potential trade between Heat and OKC which would include Dragic JJ and Herro as well as d round picks for Westbrook Am I the only Heat fan who feels bad about this No disrespect meant to Westbrook bit I really feel like Herro could be a potential Gem His fundamentals and his playstyle seem to have incredible potential for growth and I would not be surprised if he ended up becoming one of the better rookies of this draft Westbrook is good but i kinda wish Miami would stop sacrificing potential and rely purely on already made stars We have so few picks every year and we still manage to pick interesting players but then we give them away like hot bread Also I don t know I haven t been in a deep analysis of the budget so if anyone could enlighten me how will Miami s bench look like after How much do we have left to keep a competing and interesting bench team if we were to get Westbrook I really liked the idea initially especially because I want to get rid off Dragic and JJ but man I really don t feel giving up on Herro already EDIT Allow me to clarify I m not saying I want Westbrook for Miami and Miami should keep their resources I m saying considering how much resources it would take for Miami to get a potential offer for Westbrook I don t think Miami should engage in that trade What I mean to say is that I doubt that Miami can stay competitive with Westbrook due to lack of a competitive bench All the resources will probably sit on Buttler and Westbrook while a lot of money is still stuck on anderson s contract players by themselves won t carry a team to the playoffs That s why i think both OKC and thw hwat would probably be better off not trading ,t3_caj6pz

Kevin Durant's entire career has been copying Lebron. The number change is part of that. He shares his ultimate goal of beating Lebron in the Finals with his new teammate Kyrie.,Kevin Durant always seems to be comparing himself to Lebron He has tried to create a similar path to Lebron since he joined He joined a super team to win titles Sure it was an already formed super team but it was in the super team era West He has strong relationship with his agent with whom he has created a business venture He has his own TV show coming up on Apple TV It s very similar to Lebron Klutch Mav and their show with HBO Because Lebron formed a new super team in the West KD decided to form super team in the East with Kyrie Both seem to be jealous of Lebron s fame and control It s the perfect pair and why they re definitely gonna mesh He was drafted by Seattle and advocates for a team there every chance he gets prolly cause he wants to win a title for the team that drafted him like Lebron did Winning a title on return would also be a nice parallel ,t3_can71n

Let's remember some of the dumbest injuries sustained by NBA players,We obviously hate to see anyone get injured but once in a while there is an injury so clearly the player s own fault that we can call it a foolish silly nonsensical and just plain ol dumb injury without being cold or callous I present to you the dumbest injuries in league history MONTA ELLIS VS MOPED Shortly after inking a six year $ million dollar contract extension Monta Ellis severely sprained his ankle in a low speed moped accident He then compounded his mistake by telling the Warriors that he hurt himself playing pickup ball in his native Mississippi only coming clean about the accident several days later He was suspended games without pay for violating the terms of his contract which created a rift between the coaches Don Nelson and Chris Mullin who did not want to suspend him and the top brass former owner Chris Cohan So not only did he get injured lie about it create a team wide rift and lose a significant amount of his new contract but he did all this by driving a moped at low speeds SAM CASSELL VS THE BIG BALLS DANCE The Minnesota Timberwolves best chance of reaching the Finals with Kevin Garnett came in but Sam Cassell injured his hip before the start of the WCF against the Lakers The Lakers defeated the Wolves in and lost to the Detroit Pistons in the finals Said Flip Saunders about Cassell s injury It was his hip He made a shot out of the corner against Sacramento in Game of the conference semifinals and he did his little Big Balls dance and from that he created a little avulsion fracture in his hip No question I think about that dance all the time But that s the NBA I went to four straight conference finals in Minnesota and Detroit and we had injury issues in each one The team that wins the title is usually the healthiest team Ain t that the truth ANDREW BYNUM VS A BOWLING ALLEY After being traded to the Sixers in a four team trade that three teams lost Dwight to the Lakers Iguodala to the Nuggets with the only winner being Vucevic to the Magic and while rehabilitating an injury to his right knee Andrew Bynum injured his left knee when going bowling Said Bynum In hindsight I guess you shouldn t go bowling But he remained defiant adding I m taking the position that if that happens bowling what happens dunking The pre process Sixers were something else KEVIN LOVE VS SLEEPING In Kevin Love slept with his right arm extended off his bed all night and when he woke up he couldn t move it He had to miss the next game STEVE BLAKE VS A PARKING LOT Steve Blake suffered a puncture wound to his left foot after stepping on a spike strip in a parking lot He was out for three weeks Blake said he hurt himself when he got distracted going back to my truck In the end it wasn t electrical infetterence that got him CHARLES BARKLEY VS AN ERIC CLAPTON CONCERT Charles Barkley missed the Phoenix Suns season opener because the first layer of his corneas got burned off by body lotion during an Eric Clapton concert Apparently allergies and the dazzling stage lights caused Sir Charles to rub his eyes and he got lotion in them Phoenix Suns team doctor Richard Emerson said It was a chemical reaction to a type of lotion that he uses I wouldn t anticipate it ll reoccur because I don t think he ll use that type again BJ TYLER VS A PACK OF ICE Prior to the NBA season BJ Tyler was selected by the Toronto Raptors in the expansion draft According to journalist Chris Young s book Drive Tyler accidentally fell asleep with a pack of ice on his knee severely damaging it and thus losing all the speed for which he was known and subsequently had to retire BRAD MILLER VS THE DISHES On the same day he was named Western Conference Player of the Week Brad Miller needed nine stitches in his right index finger after almost chopping it off with a knife while doing the dishes Said Miller It s the last time I help do dishes Said teammate Mikki Moore When I saw him it was all wrapped up So I said You re going to drop and in two games and then go and cut your knuckle off I said That s real smart Brad He said Nah that s my luck COREY MAGETTE VS BAD CALLS During the season Corey Maggette got so upset over a call that he slammed his hand on the scorer s table in frustration and dislocated the ring and little fingers on his right hand Maggette ended up with a cast and a four week vacation DARKO MILICIC VS GARBAGE TIME Ah Darko He was put in for what was described as a token appearance in the Pistons Game blowout of the Lakers in the NBA Finals He played minutes finishing with rebound steal turnover and broken hand The injury required surgery and sidelined him for eight weeks DERRICK COLEMAN VS AVERAGE JOES literally Derrick Coleman whose NBA career was limited and cut short largely due to injury problems got injured again only this time it happened while filming an episode of the TV show Pros vs Joes Derrick was participating in a rebounding challenge against some average joe when he came down from a jump and landed awkwardly hurting his already troublesome knee Thus giving Derrick the dubious distinction of being the first Pro to ever get injured during battle with a Joe DERRICK ROSE VS HIS DESIRE FOR APPLE SLICES Then Bulls rookie Derrick Rose was forced to miss some practice time because he cut himself under the elbow of his left forearm In bed From a knife used to slice an apple Said Rose Silly accident this morning I went to get a bottle of water forgot the knife was there and sat down and sliced my arm I panicked when it first happened I called Bulls trainer Fred Tedeschi We got it stitched up about It was a large wound but they healed it up I m good I could have practiced but they told me to wait until today I can still dribble shoot do all that stuff I m hoping they ll let me play DIRK VS HIS SHOES In December before a game against the Washington Wizards Dirk Nowitzki sprained a tendon in his ankle when he put his shoe on improperly and stomped his foot on the floor to make sure it was on right He missed the game ENES KANTER VS BURGERS Enes happily tweeted about his cheat day which consisted of three triple patty burgers with eggs on them four additional burgers and a plate of fries A day after eating all that food Kanter left Knicks practice due to an illness and missed the next game Enes vehemently denied that it had anything to do with his cheat day and claimed it was an unrelated illness but the timing was certainly suspicious and the seven burgers can t have helped TY LAWSON VS TACOS Ty Lawson missed a game against the Nets due to an illness while playing for the Sacramento Kings in It was bad news for an already thin Kings roster but Lawson s illness may have been thanks to some bad taco recommendations Lawson posted an Instagram story asking for bomb taco Tuesday spots in Sacramento hours later Lawson was listed as questionable with gastroenteritis eventually missing the game EDDY CURRY VS WALKING Eddy Curry had to miss a game due to a badly sprained left ankle suffered at a walk through at a morning shoot around Said teammate Malik Rose How do you explain something like that Good question EDDY CURRY VS A PHYSIOBALL Speaking of good questions here s another Can a player suffer a more embarrassing injury than spraining his ankle during a walk through Eddy Curry can Per the New York Daily News Poor Eddy Curry He sat on the giant blue physioball during a break from Monday s practice and the ball exploded Eddy fell and scraped his wrist but should be okay The ball which is used for stretching exercises was pronounced dead at the scene I guess this explains how Eddy could get injured walking and answered the age old How do you know if you re too fat question For any youngins reading Eddy Curry was a big boy FRANCISCO GARCIA VS A PHYSIOBALL Francisco Garcia broke his arm on a physioball At least he wasn t so fat that it exploded on him GEORGE MCCLOUD VS PHONE CALLS Prior to Game of the first round playoff series between the Indiana Pacers and the Boston Celtics George McCloud held his ankle in a funny way while talking on the phone This somehow injured the ankle so badly he couldn t play in the game and had to watch from the bench in street clothes as his team got eliminated GILBERT ARENAS VS PUBIC SHAVING Let s just let Agent Zero tell the tale When I was new in the NBA the team veterans convinced me to shave you know down there because they said the hair stinks I used my girlfriend s razor which was rusty and gave me keloids The doctor prescribed medicine to dab on but I just poured it all over Three days later I woke up screaming The skin was burnt off my scrotum down to my crack everything just raw flesh I still had to run and play so I used a numbing spray for a month until it healed Now I use clippers A sound decision Gilbert GREG OSTERTAG VS WAKING UP Greg Ostertag fractured the third metacarpal on his right hand in October of when he tripped on a footstool while getting out of bed This happened after his first day of practice with his new team the Sacramento Kings AMAR E VS FIRE EXTINGUISHER During the playoffs a frustrated Amar e Stoudemire attacked a fire extinguisher minutes after the New York Knicks Game loss to the Miami Heat The Knicks power forward suffered lacerations on his left hand which required stitches Subsequently Amar e was extinguished from Game and the Pacers had a good time mocking him when the Knicks came to Indiana In other Amar e news he recently became an Israeli citizen and converted to Judaism JEFF RULAND VS A LUGGAGE CART After being out of action for five years Jeff attempted to return for the season However the comeback ended because of a luggage cart A luggage cart which was allegedly rammed into Ruland s leg by a Celtics employee as he waited for the team bus outside Boston Garden It should be noted that Ruland was not popular in Boston and as even nicknamed McNasty by the Celtics late great broadcaster Johnny Most Said Ruland I got run over by a luggage cart That s hard to swallow It can t be accidental they were moving too fast Whoever could foresee anything like this happening KENDRICK PERKINS VS A BED Then Boston big man Kendrick Perkins missed time due to a right big toe that was injured when he dropped a bed on it I ll let Perk tell it and leave it up to you to decipher it I was asleep I guess whoever put my bed together didn t put it together right when I moved so one side of my bed fell My bed was tilted so I got out of my bed to go push down on the other side And when I was about getting ready to push down on the other side the headboard started coming in So I tried to push the headboard back so it wouldn t fall over My foot was under the bed and the other side of the bed fell on my foot Man don t you hate it when that happens KEVIN JOHNSON VS CELEBRATING During the mid s Kevin Johnson won a regular season game on a buzzer beating shot and received a crippling bear hug from teammate Charles Barkley Crippling is used here in the literal sense Chuck squeezed Kevin so hard that his shoulder was dislocated He was out of action for the next two weeks Kevin also had hernia surgery in after years of abdominal problems that were allegedly brought on by picking up teammate Oliver Miller to celebrate a play LATRELL SPREWELL VS YACHT GUESTS Latrell Sprewell the man who once choked his coach PJ Carlesimo broke his hand by taking a swing at the boyfriend of a female party guest who threw up on his yacht But it seems that Spree s punch was as accurate as his jumpers he whiffed and punched the wall instead Sprewell tried to cover up the incident but some of his guests leaked the story and the Knicks fined Spree $ for not reporting the injury Sprewell complained to the press about it They talk about being a family but they re not sticking with me The biggest thing to me is that I m hurt So don t kick me when I m down Maybe the biggest thing should be avoiding punching the walls of yachts but hey what do I know LIONEL SIMMONS VS NINTENDO GAMEBOY During the season rookie Lionel Simmons developed tendonitis in his right wrist and forearm The injury was caused by Simmons playing his Nintendo GameBoy and he missed two games It s not unusual for Lionel to be focused on something Jerry Reynolds the Kings general manager at the time told reporters But to hurt himself like that TONY ALLEN VS THE BASKETBALL GODS Tony Allen blew out his knee tearing both ACL and MCL while trying to throw one down after the whistle had blown If that s not a direct message from the Basketball Gods then I don t know what is Oh and he also missed the dunk LUC LONGLEY VS BODYSURFING During the season the Bulls lost the services of their Australian center for seven weeks after he got hurt bodysurfing Luc was bodysurfing off the coast of Los Angeles coast when an unexpectedly strong wave drove him shoulder first into the ocean floor and knocked his clavicle and shoulder out of place MICHAEL JORDAN VS A CIGAR CUTTER Although Michael was unofficially retired he officially retired on January he severed a

accidentally sucking in some ointment fumes while getting treatment for a sore muscle during half time Said Bogues Never happened to me before and I hope it never happens again That was one of those fluke things you don t even dream about Is it possible that the fumes affected him more than they would other players because of his small frame VLADIMIR RADMANOVIC VS SNOWBOARDING In February Vladimir Radmanovic separated his shoulder falling on a patch of ice in Park City Utah Or so he claimed But a few days later with his conscience weighing down on him he admitted what really happened The truth is that I hurt myself in a fall while snowboarding Being young and sometimes immature I initially panicked and made up a false story about how I hurt myself However over the past few days my conscience has been bothering me terribly I am not a dishonest person and could no longer live with this deception Therefore I came forward today and told the truth to the Lakers Being that his contract specifically banned him from taking part in activities that involve significant risk of injury including skiing and snowboarding the Radman was fined $ CARLOS BOOZER VS THE DARK Carlos Boozer broke his hand after tripping over his gym because it was too dark for him to see Somebody was knocking at the door and Boozer rushed to answer On the way he tripped over his gym bag in the hall and fell He went down awkwardly on his right hand and felt it pop SCOTT WILLIAMS VS LIFE While playing for the Chicago Bulls during the Jordan less season Scott Williams had a string of bizarre injuries First he missed four days of practice after straining his shoulder at the team s annual bowling outing A few days later he hurt his back lifting a TV he bought on sale Then later in the season he injured a tendon behind his right kneecap while stretching and that was the end of his season ,t3_can2ii

Isn‚Äôt what Kawhi did with PG13 considered tampering?,The guy went specifically to a player with years left on his contract and basically convinced him to demand a trade Firstly he shouldn t have even been recruiting players who are already on contract Secondly he shouldn t be convincing players on contract to demand a trade If this is what s going to be allowed in the league then we might as well say goodbye to every small market team and just put the all star teams in New York and LA Adam Silver shouldn t allow this ,t3_cafy5e

Would Andrea Bargnani fair any better if he was in the modern nba and play beyond 30 years of age?,Simple off season question The original st pick meme generator maybe depends how you feel now about Kwame was a tall frontcourt player who was better shooting the ball than doing anything else most centers did People liked he was a tall person who could shoot They did not like much else A common knock was his lack of rebounds This was a gaping hole at a time the NBA had big man on the court at all times before small ball was widely popular and the death lineup Duncan Howard and Yao roamed the league early on in his career point shots were rarer which had an impact on rebound locations I had this thought becuase looking at the box scores for a few summer league games C s who can shoot but not necessarily rebound are starting to become a more pronounced role player archtype Or they will be in a few years Not to say he is still worthy of being a pick but would his downsides be less criticised and his career favour better if he was entering in the league today I do not really recall his very early years only late Toronto and the Knicks very well Say we saw even Meyers Leonard having an impact at times this post season Meyers shoots the about twice as much as Bargnani ever did in terms of shot selection ,t3_cai04i
The Toronto Raptors are still gonna be really good next year,They have one of the best rising stars in the game in Pascal Siakam three seasoned and solid vets in Lowry Gasol and Ibaka and they re all coming in with a fire to prove they are still a legit team Don t get me wrong losing Kawhi and Danny Green is not ideal but especially in this top heavy east division this Raptors team has a chance to be pretty damn good next year ,t3_cagw7c
Examples of bad management or bad moves from former NBA stars-turned-executives?,Among the more hardcore or more serious NBA fans it s pretty well known that NBA superstars do not make the best managers or coaches for some reason the greatness just doesn t translate Even during Magic s tenure with the Lakers Kobe Bryant said in an interview You know great basketball players don t make good GMs In light of what Laker fans consider as an amazing turnaround for the Lakers since Magic stepped down I wish to know other perspectives about why this is so as well as ask actual examples from y all I m not saying Magic didn t do any good in his leadership but here are some of my examples Magic admitted to being responsible for letting Brook Lopez walk Magic also was the one who insisted having more playmakers on the team as opposed to shooters around LeBron which led to him completing The Meme Team Despite having a vision of his own he still ended up accepting it as a mistake so he tried to correct this in the middle of the season trading in Zubac who is now worth $ m yr for Mike Muscala He got fined an all time high for tampering for a player the Lakers didn t get anyway and in the end he had to step down in the most Magic esque way This is not a thread to critique Magic further but more to learn about the experiences of other fanbases with star players who didn t fare in their front office or with the coaching clipboard as well as in the basketball court And why If you re a fan of that team how did you feel about certain moves during that particular time There are exceptions of course like Larry Bird winning coach of the year and Jerry West still proving why he is a literal icon But there are countless counters such as Michael Jordan and Isaiah Thomas Who else ,t3_cailbf

So Memphis is essentially flipping Delon Wright for Tyus Jones?,So the word is Memphis has offered Jones years $ million or at least the max the contract can be in $ million But the Grizzlies were not willing to beat an offer Dallas gave Delon Wright so the sign and trade years $ million I m assuming the sign and trade deal were the same financial terms as the offer sheet Dallas gave Delon Anyway if this is true I just don t see why Memphis would not have resigned Wright for only $ million more than Jones Delon would have been when the contract expired as opposed to Jones But Delon is a way better overall player than Tyus Jones They are both essentially destined to be career back up spot starter type players Why would Memphis essentially decide on Tyus Jones over Delon Wright ,t3_cah28z

What does Rudy Gobert do better than Whitesise on defense when they're both at the top of their game defensively?,Whiteside is stronger and more athletic He once was rd in DPOY voting while Gobert won DPOY so far When Whiteside tries and is motivated is he as good a defender as Gobert Gobert is with a wingspan while Whiteside is with a wingspan but Whiteside s superior athleticism negates that So when Whiteside is at his best and putting in effort what does Gobert do better than him on defense ,t3_cal128

Will pending RFAs start utilizing pre-free agency just like the stars have recently?,We ve seen guys like PG AD Kawhi Kyrie etc force their way off of teams while they still have years left on their deals a sort of pre free agency if you will where the player has had enough of his current organization and tries to get himself into his team of choice Restricted free agency has long been one of the most disgusting practices in the NBA allowing a team to hold a player captive if they are willing to match the price on that player s offer sheet Enabling teams to keep players that don t want to play for them anymore and therefore restricting player movement Meaning that a player is forced to play for a team that they don t actually want to play for for at least seasons rather than if it were eliminated Will the rise of pre free agency movement begin to trickle down to players while they are still on that initial year deal so they can maneuver their way off a team that hasn t earned their services and onto the team they want to play for ,t3_cakuh1
Should Miami make a run right now?,Having just swung a deal for Butler Miami are now looking at getting Westbrook too I think a combination of Winslow Dragic might entice OKC They get Dragic to tech Shai for a season amp a talent like Winslow in a good contract too However I started wondering if Miami might stop there or go for a home run swing a trade for Blake Griffin Now most of you you would think me crazy for suggesting this but Griffinf right now is a contract Detroit would love to get off their books He s not a bad player right now but as the decline comes that contract like Westbrook s is going to look ugly like Paul s looks right now They might consider letting him go for one of Johnson Olynyk or M Leonard and Waiters If Detroit shows serious inclination to move Griffin Miami might even keep Waiters off bench scoring back up to Westbrook and offer of those three names They even have Bam as a young player to offer but I doubt it ll be needed That s Westbrook Butler amp Griffin as their core for the next years It ll get ugly at the end but Miami might make some waves especially in the east Now the other route is to stand pat and wait for the Free Agency which is headlined by names like Giannis and Beal Miami is an attractive destination for any FA If they have a player like Butler already on the books and possibility of one or even two Max slots they become downright dangerous Most of their present contracts Johnson Olynyk Waiters Winslow all come of their books then On the flip side New York is also gearing up for that FA class and a lot of other teams will make runs for them too Should the Heat take that change of going after those guys and risk being left with little like New York this summer Maybe they just swing the Westbrook deal but stay away from Griffin And hope to entice just one star in the class What s your take Make a move now get both and hope for a miracle run just get Westbrook and keep one slot open for or stay away from both and roll the dice in Just to be clear I m not suggesting one path or the other Just exploring the Miami options and hoping for a constructive discussion ,t3_caktkz

The Kawhi Leonard for George Hill trade: looking back.,Ok I will admit I am a Pacer fan Although it s hard to be a fan of a team like the Pacers They seem to make poor decisions all the time The one that fans have the most trouble with is us trading Kawhi for George Hill George Hill averaged points and ast in minutes for the Spurs when we got him He actually put up slightly better numbers the year before with ppg and apg in mpg So why did we want to trade for a rd year player who was invisible his rookie year and showed a decline his rd year The answer was money from ticket sales because he was a local star Also can anyone think of a point gaurd that played those type of minutes and had stats that bad Chris Dunn had about points and ast last year in minutes and the guy is sitting there unsigned If he was still under contract imagine if Chicago saw Romeo Langford go at pick They then call up Danny Ainge to offer them Dunn and Langford goes on to becoming a perineal top player It s unreal The truth is even though PG could ve played shooting gaurd or small forward and Kawhi could ve played small forward or power forward the Pacers wanted to use Hill s name to sell tickets because he is from here and we love local basketball in Indiana Also we wanted to make the playoffs more than we wanted to build an actual contender because it s a quicker and more obtainable payday These were also the same reasons we traded for Oladipo We knew he was good enough to be the best player on a playoff team in the east We knew since he was famous locally as the best player at IU in a very long time it would boost sales and draw attention We did not know he could be a top player that part was dumb luck literally ,t3_cahpt2

Wilt Chamberlain secretly dominated professional basketball at age 16 under a false identity. Scoring as much as 46 points against pros in the Eastern U.S. with a team record of 36-1. By age 17 he was averaging 40.5ppg. This is the first time I'm sharing this research:, Wilt Chamberlain Dominating Professional basketball leagues at age and Calculated averages for year old Wilt as a Quakertown Fay in regular season games according to one of the articles ppg in playoff games according to the math not sure it s even possible but who knows in total games according to a Quakertown book Worth mentioning he won the MVP award in that league Image Image Image Image Wilt Chamberlain or as he was first known George Marcus secretly dominated professional basketball under that assumed identity at age for the Pittsburgh Raiders Even as a kid against men his own size playing professionally such as former Harlem Globetrotters he averaged by age I found game recaps of multiple point performances for the Quakertown Fay s at age and at least one point game even at age for the Pittsburgh Raiders This is not only not often talked about it s NEVER talked about I ve seen only a few references to his professional career that predated college basketball When I researched this I found out it got him into potential trouble with the NCAA and so it was kept hushed and perhaps left to be forgotten EDIT Allow me to plug one other researcher who I ve come to learn first shared the photographs of Wilt playing for the Fay s a few years ago I found him on Twitter and here s a link to a fascinating video he produced EDIT IMPORTANT UPDATE According to a Quakertown book researched by bardown staff Wilt actually averaged in all games as a Quakertown Fay He only averaged in regular season games but with playoffs combined his game average shoots up to This means ppg in the playoff games as a Fay I m not sure if this is even possible so please take with a grain of salt Though he did score points in high school and in the NBA including other point games so who knows This being against former pros his own size too including former Globetrotter Andy Maddox ,t3_6cbgx1

How my NBA experience turned into a nightmare thanks to StubHub - They denied my chance to see the final ever game at Sleep Train Arena last night by selling me invalid tickets., Here is an update since I don t think it is right to not give StubHub the positive publicity as well when they have reached out and offered to make it up to me StubHub has reached out to me and advised me that in keeping with their Buyer Guarantee of offering equal or better seats they will get me tickets to the home opener next year The rep was extremely professional and apologetic for the situation I told him they really should provide some kind of safeguards for buyers He assured me that they aggressively go after any sellers who break their rules I d have rather got in to the final game but I am happy with the outcome TL DR StubHub sold my wife and I invalid tickets to the final game ever at Sleep Train Arena ARCO Arena they did not notify me the tickets were bad I found out when we got denied by the scanner at the door Then they kept me on hold for over minutes outside the venue I missed the game and it could happen to you Let me preface this by saying I do not blame the Kings or NBA for this situation however I do think that they need to be aware of what one of their major resellers is doing to their fans I am a Sacramento Kings fan through thick and thin I scream about hating them complain and bemoan our lack of defense lack of wins lack of everything We don t have much We haven t been to the playoffs in years the second longest drought in the NBA behind the Wolves who I guarantee break that streak soon We have a superstar who teases us with his brilliance and then punishes us with his attitude and demeanor We went through an absolute nightmare of an ownership that tried not once not twice but three times to steal our team and take them to another city We just celebrated breaking thirty wins for the first time in nine years Yet I love the team to the core I ve watched this team since I was a kid In the fourth grade I had a Kings ruler with pictures of Danny Ainge Wayman Tisdale and Kenny Smith I had and still have only seen NBA games in a structure that has all of the sex appeal of a giant flat office building Sleep Train Arena it will always be ARCO to me The entire basketball nation probably knows the plight of our dilapidated arena tarps falling from the ceiling leaks when it rains toilets that don t work Yet we Kings fans love the place We always have It s the only real arena we have ever had we don t have any other major league sports in our city and this place is just cozy and fits us It is the perfect arena for a bunch of rabid fans in a city that Phil Jackson infamously called a cow town unwittingly unleashing the birth of the very loud Kings cowbells After all of the disasters of the previous ownership group we finally were blessed by a man willing to save our team Vivek Ranadive While we can argue his basketball knowledge and his hands on approach to basketball operations we cannot argue that he saved the Sacramento Kings and ponied up a lot of money to build us a brand new arena in downtown Sacramento With that very arena scheduled to open this October many of us Kings fans circled April on our calendar the final game at the old barn after years I was one of those people I frequently purchase my tickets from a variety of sources eBay StubHub Craigslist etc Where ever the best deal lies Some are obviously more risky than others Craigslist comes to mind I would not fret about buying tickets from StubHub I ve done it before plenty of times I hear their commercials all of the time on the radio I had no reason to believe that there was any risk buying tickets from their website Unfortunately I found out that I was completely wrong last night Yesterday I bought tickets to the final game at Sleep Train with a scheduled tip off against the OKC Thunder at pm I looked through StubHub and found a great dead for two tickets for my wife and I in Row H of the lower bowl The total price was $ expensive for a meaningless basketball game but not for a once in a lifetime event The Kings were going to do it up big tons of free giveaways meet and greets with former players that spanned the entire Sacramento era the opportunity to go out on the court and shoot a free throw and take pictures it was going to be an amazing close to our shabby but loved arena I purchased the tickets a little after pm yesterday from StubHub At pm I received my email confirmation with the tickets I immediately took screenshots of both tickets to scan at the door on my phone My wife and I got ready and we were on our way to drive the or so miles to the arena We arrived at approximately pm and by this point could see all of the news trucks concession stands and hear the music playing We were getting excited The parking lot was as full as I ve ever seen it We made our way past the security check point and walked up to the self scanner at the door where I pulled up the screenshots of my tickets I scanned the first one at the turnstyle REFUND flashed on the screen I stood there for a second thinking maybe it didn t register so I tried again REFUND At this point people were piling up behind me so I stepped aside feeling a little embarrassed like I was some scammer or didn t know how to use the scanner This was where I felt my first pang of panic I pulled up the second ticket and slid back in line to try again REFUND I flagged down a door attendant who tried his hand scanner on both tickets REFUND REFUND It was pm and I was in full on panic mode now The door attendant advised me to go to the box office so we tore off in that direction I desperately did not want to miss the last ever player introductions at this arena Inside the box office I was sympathetically told by the attendant I m so sorry this is a StubHub problem and we can t help you you need to call them but they re very good at refunds REFUND There s that word again I don t want a refund I want to see this game And time is tick tick ticking away I grab my phone and literally type StubHub into google as fast as my fingers will let me I find the number and call After the automated message the voice tells me the first thing I was dreading to hear all of our representatives are assisting other callers we will be with you shortly I am basically beside myself by now I am down to about minutes to tip off and I have no way through the door At pm while still on hold I got desperate and went back to the box office I asked the representative what the cheapest tickets were just to get in the building He tells me $ each for nosebleed upper bowl tickets plus fees I can t believe what I am hearing I still don t know the status of my StubHub tickets so now I am faced with the choice of buying these tickets in front of me for more than the lower bowl tickets that I should already have in my possession or continuing to wait on hold I don t know if I am getting a refund or not for the StubHub tickets since no one will answer the phone and am afraid of buying four tickets The box office rep says to me man I m so sorry we ve been seeing this all night from StubHub pm pm pm pm By pm I came to the realization that I was not going to see this game My wife and I started the most depressing dejected walk back to our car imaginable About halfway there the StubHub rep finally came on the line after minutes on hold I calmly as possible explained my situation to him and asked him exactly what had happened He was unable to explain why my tickets would not work I asked him point blank Did the guy who sold me these tickets also sell them to someone else He would not answer just saying that sometimes there are issues with the tickets I kept pressing him asking him why I was not notified that my tickets would not work before I got to the door At least then I would have had an opportunity to get different ones The only email I received at that point was my confirmation He told me that they do not monitor the transactions so if there is an issue you will not know until you get denied at the door I couldn t believe that I was not getting an answer as to why my tickets would not work I explained to him that this was not just any game this is a one time event I could tell that he was starting to understand the gravity of my situation I kept pushing him about the seller and how this happened That s when he dropped the bomb on me He said and I quote I probably shouldn t tell you this but the seller you bought these tickets from is already under investigation for selling bad tickets So there it is StubHub knew that this guy is selling bad tickets on their site Or at the very least he is selling the same tickets to multiple people The rep told me that he would be investigated which mean absolutely nothing to me standing in the parking lot He told me he would issue a refund for the price of the tickets and offered me off of my next purchase It wasn t then and it s not now about the money We missed something that we had our heart set on We went to a nearby restaurant and watched the game on TV which honestly felt more painful It was basically everything we knew it would be a great halftime show featuring the past players sentimental videos the roar of the sell out crowd as the game came down to the final shot with the Kings winning it with second on the clock But it wasn t about the game on the court it was about the atmosphere in the building And we missed it The final kick in the teeth came on the drive home as I listened to the post game on AM radio During a commercial break there was a StubHub ad talking about their guarantee to get you in the game I couldn t believe it As soon as I got home I fired off an email to StubHub explaining what happened PART and PART This morning I got the response which was basically a form letter with some things changed in it They ask me to call them back so that they can further investigate I called them and the rep I spoke to had no idea why I was calling in saying oh they already are looking into the seller They probably just wanted you to call to verify you received your refund I knew I got my refund last night I asked him if he at least saw the discount on my account for my next purchase and he said No I don t see it but I will make sure I add it right now It s actually a credit based on the purchase price of the tickets you already bought At this point whatever So he tells me based on the price of $ my credit on my account will be $ Not nearly what I think I should get for what I missed but I know I m not going to get anywhere with this guy He thanks me for using StubHub and the call ends A couple of minutes later an email comes through showing the credit issued to my account $ Only missed the mark by $ At this point I am at a loss for words I have sent off yet another email re explaining everything and asking the questions Why does the seller retain control over tickets that he sold and received money for Why does StubHub not warn it s buyers that you will not make it in to your event if the seller chooses to take his tickets back and resell them to someone else Why was I never advised before I made it to the gate that I was not going to get in Had I been advised with enough time I could have received my refund and still bought other tickets By the time I found out I wasn t getting in and then waited on hold for minutes I missed my chance to get in Why was the offer of equal or better seats never given to me at the time I would have been mad at missing the first quarter but at least I would have seen the final three quarters Why is there not some sort of seller feedback system to warn buyers of fraudulent sellers similar to eBay By their own representative s admission this seller was known to StubHub to be a potentially fraudulent seller Had I known this guy had issues I obviously would have avoided the listing Here is StubHub s guarantee straight from their website Summary of StubHub guarantee to Buyers You will get your tickets in time for the event Your tickets will be valid for entry Your tickets will be the same as those you ordered If any of these things do not occur and you comply with applicable policies and timelines we will find you comparable or better tickets to the event or offer you a refund or FanCode for future purchase I was never at any point last night offered comparable or better tickets Even though at that point I would have been mad as I had already missed the first quarter I apologize for the exceptionally long post I want to warn people about StubHub and tell everyone that this company is no better than buying from some stranger on Craigslist I hope this gains some traction so that no one else has to go through something as bad as this ,t3_4e8ikq

Rachel Nichols and the ESPN crew were extremely disrespectful last night,I m not sure if this has been posted by someone already but I just wanted to say that the things they let Rachel Nichols and Woj say during the draft lottery were blatantly disrespectful to all of the teams save for maybe the Knicks to all of the other draft picks and to the Pelicans Not to mention the fact that everything they were saying was being blasted throughout the entire venue First off there were over a dozen teams in attendance last night The only one that they chose to talk about the Knicks They talked unbelievably liberally about Zion going to NY as if they had already won it However as I doubt any of them realized the Knicks had the same chance of obtaining the pick as the Cavs and the Suns the latter of which I don t even think was mentioned once on the broadcast Then there was Zion Rachel Nichols kept referring to the pick as who gets Zion Every time she said that or mentioned the kid the camera would cut to the embarrassed y o who was just there to see what team picks where There is no guarantee that Zion will go overall It is very very likely but not guaranteed Not to mention that they did this in front of a large number of draft prospects in attendance What does all of this coverage and press mean to them if it s only going to Zion And finally the Pelicans Woj made every team s case for a possible AD trade that night Whenever a team with chances of getting a top pick was mentioned Woj had to slip in that they may be looking to use that pick as an asset to trade for AD I m honestly very happy the Pelicans won because the disrespect they were receiving the whole night was greatly trumped when they won the first pick Now I get all of these things are said ten times over on any other sports news broadcast However as I said Rachel Nichols audio was blasted for everyone at the event to hear including the draft prospects and team representatives After watching this I asked my dad if there was ever a time where the media would be able to speak this liberally about sports in front of all of those people He said no EDIT Apparently there are rumors circulating that Rachel Nichols was drunk Honestly that s not surprising,t3_bowigy

The Outrage of NBA Fans is Disproportionate.,I d like to preface this by stating that what GSW part owner Mark Stevens did in game was unacceptable He pushed Kyle Lowry and deserves to be fined and suspended from attending games amp nbsp However it is my opinion that the outcry has been wildly disproportionate to other acts of violence in the NBA amp nbsp I realise that it was less about the fact that the year old Silicon Valley venture capitalist might ve hurt Lowry with his left handed push and was more just the fact that he laid his hands on a player in an unfriendly way amp nbsp The public outcry has been intense People are calling for a lifetime ban and demanding that he be forced to sell his shares in the team The incident is already written on his Wikipedia page amp nbsp People are out for blood with Kyle Lowry leading the charge amp nbsp gt A guy like that showing his true class and he shouldn t be a part of our league There s just no place for that amp nbsp gt The support I ve gotten from fellow players the league has been unbelievable With that being said I think more should be done amp nbsp gt I have young children and being able to hold myself to a certain standard Which I do I hold myself to a high high standard amp nbsp These are all quotes from Kyle Lowry The same Kyle Lowry who in pled guilty to the battery of a female referee at a charity basketball game amp nbsp This was one of his quotes on that day amp nbsp gt B meet me outside I will kick your a amp nbsp He then proceeded to throw a basketball at her for a second time as hard as he could He potentially received a fine of up to $ and was suspended for games times less than Mark Stevens got for his push The fine was from a judge in a courtroom and not even from the league The league did nothing There is no mention of this on Lowry s wikipedia page amp nbsp If Lowry thinks $ and a year ban is soft for Mark Stevens then I wonder what he thought about his $ game punishment for battery of a woman in amp nbsp In August of beloved NBA clown Lance Stephenson pushed his pregnant girlfriend down a staircase and then proceeded to bash her head against the stairs amp nbsp Two years prior to this he sexually assaulted a year old girl at his high school amp nbsp He went on to play over NBA games and earn over $ million dollars amp nbsp At the time of the staircase attack he hadn t played a single NBA game years later he s still in the league amp nbsp I was a fan of Lance but only because I d never heard this mentioned in a single one of his games I even paid actual money to buy his Charlotte Hornets jersey I wore his name and number on my back Call me old fashioned but I think that the second you bash your pregnant girlfriend s head against some stairs you should forfeit the privilege of playing NBA basketball amp nbsp OJ Mayo and Tyreke Evans were both given year bans for violating the NBA anti drug program The NBA is prohibited from disclosing what type of drugs they were found to have taken but reports suggest the violations were related to drugs of abuse which implies they were recreational and not performance enhancing amp nbsp Jason Kidd was fined $ by a judge for abusing his wife He was suspended for games amp nbsp Darren Collison Jason Kidd Jason Richardson The NBA has a history of letting abusers off lightly All just because they re good at basketball amp nbsp I m a firm believer in forgiveness and giving people second chances but if Kyle Lowry and NBA fans think Mark Stevens should be banned for life then Kyle Lowry should ve never become a Raptor Jason Kidd should not be the league s highest paid assistant coach and Lance Stephenson should ve never played a minute in the NBA amp nbsp ,t3_byskdn

Carmelo Anthony was never a top 5 player. Not even once.,I was in the Hates Melo thread about to reply to someone arguing Melo actually used to be top then I decided fuck it I ve always hated melo s game What follows is me trying to illustrate that not only was Melo not a top player of his era he was never a top player at all Not even fucking once I m doing this for me Melo at a glance only twice made it out of the first round th all time in ws tied with Corey Maggette not in top for career TS not in top for career Offensive Rating made up for this relative inefficiency by not passing much or trying on defense tried to combat questions about work ethic by posting video of himself jogging this entire article The Most Overated Player of his Era Anthony has made all star games and was often cited as a top player Carmelo s net offensive and defensive rating are the exactly the same That means he s giving up a lot of what he gives you And as mentioned above isn t anything special Here is the full list of players who have made at least all star games with Carmelo s defensive rating or worse capped at Melo s offensive rating Carmelo Joe Johnson Tom Chambers Latrell Sprewell Richard Hamilton Carmelo is the best version of that tier of player Yet he has to this point made more money than LeBron James Here s the list of those same guys who have made the hall of fame You don t have to click on the link because it s nobody Melo in Denver Melo was actually good in denver Sure Melo was a top player in denver No While more dynamic than his plodding interminably jab stepping Knicks iteration he was never actually a top player He only made it out of the first round once First Melo has never been better than LeBron Lebron was born on December th He was immediately better than Carmelo Every second since that moment LeBron has been increasing the distance between them They came into the league at the same moment one committed to perpetual improvement the other Carmelo Anthony Twin spaceships traveling at different velocities To calculate the distance between them now you d have to figure out some way to make Melo s spaceship actually start going in reverse and then explode I m too dumb to figure that out so we re moving on Second Denver Melo was never better than Kobe or Dirk From there wasnt a single season he was better than Kobe or Dirk Melo never finishes above these guys in all nba over this period Not once More importantly with the benefit of retrospect we can see these two along with LeBron were great every season always healthy and whenever they had any talent around them contended for titles MVPs They got everything out of their team year after year There s not a single season you wouldn t trade Melo for one of these three and improve Denver To preemptively shut down the idea Melo was better than Dirk in when he beat the Mavs in the second round Dirk averaged on shooting in that series if you put Dirk on that Nuggets team they would ve been even better Dirk was also st team All Nba to Melo s rd Melo also didn t even make the all star team So Melo is at best the th best player any season from I now just have to establish that there were at least other guys who were better each season during that period and I can knock Denver Melo out of the top rankings Numbers Here i m going to list three players in any order that I think were conclusively better than Melo in each corresponding season Why three when I only need two Because fuck Melo Honestly in a lot of these seasons I could list players Finally just because someone like Nash or Duncan drops out doesnt necessarily mean I think they re no longer better than Melo they probably are it s just that there are more inarguable players Nash Nash Nash Dwight Dwight Dwight Rose Duncan Duncan Duncan CP CP Durant Durant Shaq Wade Wade Garnett Wade Wade Wade Melo in New York Unlike his team USA compatriots Melo was uninterested in forming a superteam instead taking the money and forcing his way to the Knicks While not as athletic as Denver Melo it was in NYC where Anthony peaked as a shooter It s also here where he gained more weight and started missing lots of games He won one playoff series in his entire time with the Knicks In the east guys And then it got worse Knicks Melo never made the playoffs let alone an all nba team after so we can pretty much throw all those years out for top purposes Just because people still thought he was good I went all the way to where became pretty clear he s wasnt even top anymore Kobe and Dirk start declining here so I expanded it to players besides LeBron Still wasnt very hard Durant basically slots in for Dirk as the new non Lebron forward always clearly ahead of Melo As a sidenote the Denver Nuggets won more games than the Knicks in of the next seasons including in and only finished behind in by game to Kobe Duncan Steph Steph Durant Durant Durant Durant CP CP CP Westbrook Dwight Harden Harden The year Melo might have been top Ok even I have to admit this In Melo has a decent case for his only top season He leads the league in scoring shoots a good percentage and even wins a playoff series It s by far his best season as a Knick and likely the best season of his career He has a career high in ws with and finishes th overall in offensive win shares really high for him Melo also finishes rd in MVP voting and while I think this is partially because of his exaggerated reputation at the time and being in NYC he did have a great year Still though LeBron Durant clearly better CP has far better advanced stats and won more games in a harder conference Tim Duncan makes st team all nba and is the best player on the Spurs team that goes to the finals Marc Gasol wins Defensive player of the year wins more games and goes to the western conference finals He finishes rd in VoRP behind LeBron and Durant It s counter intuitive but Gasol has a really strong argument That s but we also have Harden and Curry starting to push their way into the conversation and honestly I d take either of them over Melo in That s Maybe I m wrong there Maybe Melo was top in But that would be his one year as a top player One very debatable season The next year he misses the playoffs and falls out of the conversation forever Melo in OKC Nope,t3_8xkmtb

‚ÄòTwas the night before Kawhismas, Twas the night before Kawhismas and all through r nba not a keyboard was silent not even a mouse The shitposts were posted by nephews with care in hopes that sweet upvotes soon would be there The Canadians were nestled all snug at Tim Hortons visions of Nav dancing they cried out oh Board Man And Magic in LA and Ballmer there too They d just calmed the hell down which was long over due When all of a sudden there arose a new tweet People sprang to hit new to see who had who beat Away to their phones they flew like a flash They smashed on f and prayed the whole internet didn t crash Lebron sees his chance of a new superteam grow But ask him if it is one and I m sure he ll say no When what to our wondering eyes should appear Why a brand new post right there in the clear With a little bold writer so lively and quick I knew in that moment a woj bomb I did click More rapid than raptors his words they came And he stayed very silent his sources he never names Now SIMMONS now SHAMS now SKIP and SHANNON on RDA on Masai on Windhorst and JALEN To the top of the window To the Top of r all The excitement s so palpable there s sweat on my balls As band wagoners that before a big trade trade fly When someone calls out their flair switch they say bye bitch bye False alarm Yes sadly Woj did have some news about the Greek freak YES but just about his new shoes They sprang to their helicopter the cameramen they did go And away they all flew to a car tbt to that white bronco But I heard the Klaw say as he drove out of sight Indubitably Happy Kawhismas to all and to r all good night ,t3_c8wgi4

Is having Lebron really worth the trouble?,People were interested in seeing how I came up with the value Lebron brings to the Cavs Dan Gilbert and Downtown Cleveland as a whole I ve decided to make this thread so those that were interested could see how I arrived at the valuation A few days ago an interesting thread arose accusing Lebron of handicapping the Cavs this offseason Because of his contract demands for his friends the Cavs could not make many offseason moves Further they re having to pay tens of millions in luxury tax just to make this man happy This prompted u jushin to ask gt Has anyone looked at how much value Cavs would lose if Lebron left vs the tax savings Why is Dan Gilbert so willing to pay out the nose in luxury taxes rather than let Lebron walk and pocket the savings Surely he s not worth it at this point right Let s begin by looking at attendance before we get into the financial aspect How many more faces travel to Quicken Loans Arena to see the King gt Attendance prior to return gt Return gt Given home games this is more people coming in yearly compared to the most recent season without him With playoffs that is at LEAST another people whose offseason has not come early provided there is a minimum playoff home games To get this number I accounted for the fact that QLA would have a patronage of because the team has not made the playoffs without Lebron in the last years so each home game is an increase by Interesting to note Quicken Loans Arena max capacity is you ve guessed it people The arena has been sold out every game since Lebron s return Now let s look at revenue gt Year before $ M gt Return $ M gt $ M I m going to say was an outlier year Lebron announced his return in July months before the NBA season began The organization may have needed time to adjust to the sudden good fortune In after having Lebron for a full regular and offseason the team took advantage of his prowess posting a revenue of $ M A lot of people asked about playoff revenue The Cavaliers make an average of $ per fan at full capacity during the regular season Assuming a sweep each round we get hosted home games per post season This gives us $ a year in revenue brought in SOLELY FROM HAVING LEBRON ON THE TEAM He s been a lock to make the finals every year and for a team that suffered four straight years of zero playoff games this is literally money they would not see without him The Cavaliers had an operating loss of m in the season I should note that this is the only loss the team has seen since drafting Lebron This is wholly attributed to the dramatic increase in player expenses this year In the team spent M on players In this number rose to a whopping $ M Before that the Cavaliers went from an average operating income of $ m a year without Lebron to $ a year between This is interesting to note because given these figures the team s actual operating hit from adding Lebron drops to around $ M Mr Gilbert has suffered a net loss from re signing Lebron of $ M so far Let s see if he makes it back into the black The Cavalier s player expense hit is a sight to behold Luxury tax ain t no joke However after this season the Cavaliers have a lot of salaries coming off the books and will only have $ M in owed player expenses Were Dan Gilbert to resign Lebron find cheaper talent and maintain a revenue stream of let s say $ M to be conservative he would make out like a bandit Lebron would demand a salary higher than Curry s and Harden s yes but the team also has multiple deals coming in that would offset this Goodyear I believe just signed on a $ m year logo placement and the local tv deal of ten years at $ m a year ended this past season and is expected to at least double when the new deal is signed All of that is in the future however Let s look at what Lebron has already brought him gt Edit Some people are taking issue with his impact on the valuation of the team as a whole Whether it be the Clippers sale or revenue sharing It was just a quick thing I noticed while putting this together and thought it would be interesting to add Has no effect on the amount of revenue Lebron generates yearly Dude brings in bank I ll still leave it below though gt gt Cavs value year before return M gt Year of M gt $ gt gt Wow Dan Gilbert s networth is $ The team he purchased at $ M has ballooned to become an asset worth $ Lebron is literally responsible for $ M of his net worth from basketball operations alone Basketball operations alone Donajello are you saying that Lebron has generated even MORE wealth for Dan Gilbert Short answer yes Long answer you should probably sit down for this With foot traffic in downtown Cleveland skyrocketing with everyone coming to watch Lebron play it is only natural that local businesses would reap the rewards Dan Gilbert is the largest solo investor into the downtown Cleveland economy He has invested more than $ B into the area and is the owner of local businesses This includes clubs bars and restaurants all things people look for after a high octane game Bar owners in the area ranging from small to large have seen an increase in revenue of on game nights Demand for local hotel rooms have risen since Lebron s return Lebron s presence increased the number of restaurants within mile of a stadium by about and the number of eating and drinking establishments by about to meet demand per a Harvard study Employment in the hospitality industry in increased upon the King s return How much is all this worth A study funded by the city of Cleveland along with the Cavaliers that was conducted by The Plain Dealer estimated in that Lebron James was key to bringing $ per additional person downtown to see a home game This includes parking dinners occasional hotels and other expenses That s about $ k a night and $ a year The study also estimated that the downtown area sees an increase in foot traffic of during playoffs That gives us $ over home games Note the original estimate in the study of $ included ticket prices I ve removed the $ average ticket price because we are solely looking at revenue outside of the stadium Their number did NOT include concession spending TL DR Dan Gilbert suffered a $ m loss $ m of that coming from luxury taxes last season Lebron increased team revenue by $ M from the highest grossing year without him to today Outside of the stadium Lebron is responsible for $ in spending during the season in downtown Cleveland and $ during playoffs Dan Gilbert owns the Cavaliers and is the largest investor into downtown Cleveland to the tune of over $ B and businesses Lebron has brought in about $ a year just by coming back home Why would Dan Gilbert and the organization hop jump and skip to please Lebron even to the point of paying exorbitant luxury taxes to sign his friends Well the proof is in the numbers No king has been this profitable since Midas Edit Lebron has even brought me gold Is there anything this man cannot do Seriously thank you kind stranger Going to quickly clarify a few common questions Like folks asked the same things The City of Cleveland reported an increase in traffic to the downtown area of PER DAY A HOME PLAYOFF GAME WAS PLAYED $ for the lowest estimate $ doesnt mean every person literally spent $ per night The city took their increased revenue and divided by the increased traffic on game nights No Dan Gilbert doesn t make every penny of the M year Lebron brings to the downtown area However businesses saw an average yearly increase in revenue ranging from to depending on their size much of this coming during the period of playoffs Gilbert owns billions worth of businesses in the area revenue of those businesses increased as a direct result of the increased spending The Clippers sold for $ B Thanks I get it Lebron isn t responsible for ALL of the valuation but he does add to it However that has ZERO impact on the revenue he brings in from people who come to see him play which is my main concern No one travels to Cleveland because they heard the Clippers were sold C mon now ,t3_6olkrv

league about the players acclimation to the NBA game for the casual or veteran basketball fan.", Disclaimer I am far from an expert But I m a tape and tactics junky who has dabbled in some VERY LOW level coaching If you are a very experienced X O basketball fan most of what I m saying will be obvious Hell most of it is logical anyway But hopefully even ya ll can get something out of this and please feel free to chime in with thoughts and suggestions or disagreements to help everyone get the most out of their summer league experience I love summer league Besides the first week of Free Agency it s the best part of the offseason Watching everyone from highly touted young players to low level G League long shots is an exciting and high stakes event And while many top players often sit out they are only a small part of what makes summer league fun The problem is we still don t really know what we can learn from summer league Is it predicative of season performance Can we learn if players will be good NBA players The first thing to understand is that the answer to those questions has usually been a pretty resounding no Playing well in summer league does not mean you will play well in the NBA Similarly performing poorly in summer league is far from a death sentence And yet part of summer league outside of total performance can actually be incredibly helpful to understand if the player will make an impact during their rookie year so long as you don t forget the context in which a player is playing Rookie some NBA experience years old or years old These things are always important to keep in mind So what do we look for in summer league that can be relevant to the players career The key to understanding summer league is that we are looking predominantly at a few traits which mostly cannot be found in a box score These traits tend to be predicative of early NBA success They are Does the player understand the feel of the NBA game Does the player possess projectionable NBA skills Does the player have a repeatable and efficient shooting form Each of these can be strong indicators of whether the player can have early value in the NBA It is important to note that because these players are so raw this can tell you a lot about their immediate value It will tell us much less if anything at all about their long term value Players improve or regress It is also important to not live at the summer league box scores Because of the tiny sample size and differing levels of experience and over relevancy of teammates stats really don t give us a particularly good summer league picture So put your statistics both advanced as well as basic aside for the time being and let s dive into some skill evaluation Let s get into the big Does the player understand the feel of the NBA game The NBA operates predominantly as a spread offense league Spacing is valued attacking the basket becomes critical and a mid range game not necessarily shooting but occupying that space as a roller facilitator cutter and most importantly the pick and roll becomes a staple of most league offenses On defense NBA teams play very little zone They have extremely complex help heavy schemes that require quick rotations These are waaay more complex than anything these players have seen before with the partial exception of guys who have played high level Euroleague ball Most colleges and many international teams don t have the same style of play as the NBA exceptions like the old Dribble Drive Motion Kentucky Offense have given prospects from UK an advantage during summer league and during their initial NBA seasons But even those pro style offenses are far from the choreographed dance combined with improv that define modern NBA offense and defense Watch for prospects that seem to understand NBA movement Look for shooters who move with the ball to create passing lanes on the dribble drive Tyler Herro is ABSOLUTELY A NATURAL Also a UK grad The guys who understand that when a player drives baseline you either cut weakside crash to the corner for the spot up or find space elsewhere they often retain these skills in the NBA Similarly if a player is NOT moving with the dribble drive that s a red flag Look for ball handlers in the pick and roll Get excited about the big ball handlers who can make plays in space and use their size for finishing and passing over the defense Iggy Brazdeikas I SEE YOU He was brilliant navigating the PnR the other night For smaller ball handlers do they know how to change speed attack keep defenders on their back and finish over length Jarod Harper has been another player to watch Defensively are guards dying on picks or are they staying with the play Are bigs hedging hard every time OR are they dropping low or do they get caught in the middle no man s land Ask yourself are the players moving well away from the ball Or do they just stand there besides a cut here and there Do they end up running into other players on drives Do they get in the way of their teammates attacking the rim How are players finishing Athletes should be leveraging their ability to finish above or around the defense Are smaller and less athletic players finding ways to avoid the defense by being clever Maybe that means fakes Maybe it s misdirection of which hand or side of the rim they will finish on Creativity is one of the most important things to look for Does a player react well and make plays when the offense goes bad especially look for clever passing and timely off ball cutting and steals on defense Do players stay close to their man on defense or do they lose them off ball because they get caught ball watching I love you I m a huge fan and think you will be great but he is a great example of a guy who keeps getting lost away from the ball on both offense and defense If you are watching closely you will see a hilariously clear difference between players with NBA experience and those who are young rookies just watch how far Troy Brown Jr has come in terms of knowing where to be and how the offense runs Compare that to a player who looks absolutely lost like Nasir Little One last bonus piece Do they play fast Are they decisive So many players catch the ball and think about what they are going to do with it They ball stop like crazy If your name is James Harden or LeBron James ball stop all you damn please But if you are going to be a productive NBA role player you need to be used to immediately dribbling passing or shooting as soon as you get the ball The NBA is a game of inches and milliseconds You can t give up any advantage The all time great at this is Iguodala Dude knows what he wants to do seconds before anyone else on the court He fidgets as he waits for the ball seeing an opening that isn t there yet and immediately attacking so that as soon as an opportunity to pass or drive or screen presents itself he s already there One player who did this so well in summer league and then went on to continue doing so in the NBA is Kyle Kuzma One of the first clues that he was going to succeed was how quickly he played attacking closeouts and using defender s momentum against them Does the player possess projectionable NBA skills How is the player s ball handling in small spaces Especially for the bigger players summer league is a great opportunity to see them handle the ball on the break Watch the PnR in particular Do guards keep the ball low Do they have a high dribble frequency Do the players slide their feet well on defense Watch closely for player footwork both offensively and defensively in the post and on the wings Do they close out with good form chopping their feet and staying low as long as they can as they reach the shooter Do they trip over themselves in the post Are they getting turned around Rui I love you but we gotta get those issues ironed out These are some of the questions to ask because those are skills that directly translate to the NBA immediately If a guy is good at boxing out and playing big on the boards he s probably going to be pretty damn good at it in the NBA Check the box outs Do they play big Are they physical When they roll on cuts or after screen do they create a wide powerful passing target with their shoulders I know Mitchel Robinson is already an NBA player but he s a great comparison point for other bigs Does the player have a repeatable shooting form This is of course related to the previous trait but it s so important and unique it deserves its own category Shooting is quite possibly the most important part of the NBA And we can get a great look at it with summer league Here is the catch DO NOT FOCUS ON SHOOTING PERCENTAGE Summer league is not long enough and features too many variables to make shooting data reliable Instead look at the players shot mechanics The biggest red flag The release speed If a player wants to be a good shooter in the NBA they almost always need a quick release They won t be able to get their shot off otherwise Many of ya ll noticed Zion s slow release in his first game That s a big red flag On the flip side Kyle Guy Carson Edwards and NAW have shown exceptional release Are shooters shooting in a compact way Are big men able to catch smoothly and go into their shot in one motion Do players shooting off the dribble gather well as they transfer the ball to their shooting pocket Are elbows being kept tight and does anyone have a hitch in their shot You can succeed with atypical shot mechanics Someone put in that Hiiii Kevin thing from SpongeBob but with KD instead but it s certainly less likely so it s something worth watching So there ya go It s just a small amount of the many things worth watching in summer league but hopefully if you were wondering to yourself Well if being good or bad in summer league doesn t matter how can we learn anything this can hopefully be a partial answer to that question There is so much to watch for when we view young prospects tons of which can give us insight into how they will preform as rookies I d love to hear peoples thoughts on what they ve seen from summer league so far which players have stood out and what skill sets they have demonstrated TL DR Summer league can tell you a lot about how players will play in the NBA It won t tell you if they will be successful or not but if you watch these things you can spot early red flags or areas of promise that will often transfer over to the NBA regular season Don t worry about stats Don t worry about performance Watch skill development and see how they adjust to NBA style offense and defense It is my belief that if you do so you can have a more fulfilling and productive summer league watching experience ,t3_cblgoj

"A Russell Westbrook trade would be the big story, but Danilo Gallinari is still a damn good player too. What trade destinations make sense for him?",Lost in the shuffle of the shocking Kawhi Leonard Paul George news is that the Oklahoma City Thunder acquired a darn good player in Danilo Gallinari as part of the package And in the event of a rebuild Gallinari may be on the move again Given that I wanted to examine his merits and some possible destinations for him Gallinari s value as a player Frankly Danilo Gallinari may be one of the most underrated players in the NBA right now He quietly had a great season for the Clippers averaging points and rebounds per game Better yet he shot a blistering from three attempts per game In a league thirsty for spacing he s a refreshing glass of Italian ice That said Gallinari s more than just a spacer We have a tendency to lump him in with other tall European white shooters but he has a broader offensive skill set than that Gallinari can function as a lead option on offense He s particularly adapt and attacking and getting to the line This past season he averaged free throw attempts per game hitting That FTA number has been as high as as recently as three seasons ago That ability to get to the line adds another dimension to his scoring prowess and also inflates his efficiency this past year he registered a true shooting percentage Defensively Gallinari isn t any great shakes but he s not bad either In fact ESPN s RPM rates him at a dead even impact on that end He s not terribly athletic but his size and basketball IQ allows him to blend in on that end Now he s more comfortable guarding stretch fours than small forwards but there should be a place to hide him on defense if need be Gallinari s value as an asset In terms of determining Gallinari s trade value there are more complications than the skill level alone As mentioned he s right now and turning in a few months More troubling he is also one of the more injury prone players in the NBA The games he played this year for the Clippers was seen more as a pleasant surprise than the norm Since tearing his ACL in he s played an average of games in the regular season with the this year being the high water mark Given the injury concerns many blasted the Clippers signing of Gallinari as a risky overpay years $ M In fact some even considered his contract an albatross that you d need to attach assets to shed However that deal is expiring now so we re only talking about year $ If Gallinari can play games then he may actually merit that value However the risks associated with the age injury and high salary deflate his overall value to some degree possible trade fits DETROIT PISTONS why them For the most part the Detroit Pistons have stayed out of the headlines this summer and retained the majority of their core And given that they may have a hard time breaking out mediocrity last year To take that next step and compete for R they may need another piece With the team is locked in with Blake Griffin and Andre Drummond at PF C Gallinari isn t a seamless fit However he could play half his minutes at SF and then soak up the majority of the PF minutes when Griffin rests or is injured himself Wherever you slot him Gallinari s shooting and scoring would be a welcome sight for a team that ranked st in offense despite an awesome Blake Griffin year what s the return The Pistons are never lacking for sizable contracts to throw into trade offers so they could match salaries with Tony Snell $ and Langston Galloway $ Of course the Thunder aren t going to give Gallinari away so we d need to attach an actual asset to that as well A lottery protected R pick would be a simple or clean way to do it but the Thunder may try to push for their recent R picks Sekou Doumbouya too promising to include or Luke Kennard instead I happen to love Kennard s potential as a viable starting SG but coach Dwane Casey has not fully embraced him yet If the Thunder can get Kennard out of this deal his shooting would represent a great long term fit next to Shai Gilgeous Alexander in the backcourt The Pistons should not part with Kennard lightly but it s worth making a phone call to test their resolve desperation anyway MIAMI HEAT why them Like Detroit Miami is stuck in the middle of the NBA right now With Jimmy Butler in tow they should be able to return to the playoffs but winning a first round series will be an uphill battle To push them over the top they probably need one more piece Obviously the one big piece that Miami is eyeing from OKC is not Danilo Gallinari but he would also make sense for them as a stretch four He d add another scorer to a team that finished th in offense last year Defensively Butler should be able to take the harder matchups and allow Gallinari to thrive as a secondary scorer Miami s great training staff may be able to keep Gallinari healthy as well what s the return In terms of a pure Gallinari trade this one gets more difficult Like Detroit Miami has some bad contracts they can include to make the math work Meyers Leonard at $ James Johnson at $ Kelly Olynyk at $ Dion Waiters at $ but those are year deals not expirings Miami is also lacking in future R picks two of which belong to OKC already Miami s young assets may also be too good to include in a Gallinari deal Justise Winslow and Bam Adebayo are off the table In theory R pick Tyler Herro would be an appealing addition to the Thunder Like Luke Kennard he s a good shooter who s limited by his length in that way he d be a great fit alongside Shai Gilgeous Alexander However Herro is lighting up the Summer League right now so it d be desperate to include him for one year of Danilo Gallinari Overall it s difficult to see a straight Gallinari trade work but including him in a potential Russell Westbrook deal would make a ton of sense on both sides Westbrook Jimmy Butler would be a fierce punch but they would need great shooting around them to actually make the basketball chemistry click PORTLAND TRAIL BLAZERS why them Portland s not stuck in basketball purgatory by any means but they may be stuck in the land good but not great ness GM Neil Olshey clearly didn t feel satisfied with a Conference Finals appearance and made some tweaks already He cleaned house at forward losing Evan Turner Moe Harkless and Al Farouq Aminu and brought in new additions like Hassan Whiteside and Kent Bazemore Yet you can t help but wonder if the Blazers are still one piece away They ve had a need for a more dynamic PF for some time now but haven t seemed to found that third option to take the pressure off Damian Lillard and McCollum Danilo Gallinari could absolutely do that In fact with Gallinari as a third scorer this Blazers team may jump into genuine title contention what s the return While I love the roster fit of Danilo Gallinari in Portland trying to find the perfect trade in return would be difficult In terms of matching salaries you d likely have to include Kent Bazemore $ The trouble is while Bazemore is overpaid he s still a quality player right now I d prefer Gallinari of the two but it s not an incredible upgrade And as a result the extra asset that Portland would include in a trade would be more marginal That considered Blazers would presumably be reluctant to include their best young assets in a deal To me that would be R pick Nassir Little While Little fell to the spot he still has a ton of upside in the tank In terms of his physical tools and mental makeup he reminds me of Jaylen Brown Those raw tools would make an ideal target for OKC but a hard one for Portland to sell off If we re being more practical we d have to lower the asking price Would Portland be willing to include a future protected R pick in the deal Or lower tier prospects like Anfernee Simons or Gary Trent Jr Possibly Regardless of what the negotiation turns into this match makes sense on both sides OKC will want to get younger and Portland will want to take their shot at the title while their window is still open OTHER TEAMS Honestly Danilo Gallinari fits with most NBA teams in terms of his skill set He can be a spacer and complementary scorer The trickier part is finding a proper match in terms of the compensation given his contract status These came to mind for me but I d be curious to hear other potential deals in the comments below ,t3_cbgz4b

[Discussion/OC] The Jerami Grant trade gave OKC a lot of leverage in any potential Russell Westbrook trade.,So I feel like there s this misconstrued idea out there that the main reason OKC are looking to trade Westbrook is to gain cap relief and that s simply not true or at least not anymore A bit of background info Prior to the Grant trade OKC were $ million over the luxury tax line When your payroll is above the luxury tax line for straight seasons or for the rd time in seasons you re required to pay what s called a repeater tax The Thunder have been a perennial luxury repeater tax team for a while now which meant for the season they would ve been paying roughly a x multiple on every dollar spent over the tax line What would that have meant an additional $ million in tax dollars Now there s a reason Jerami Grant $ million was shipped off to Denver relatively on the cheap with no salary returns The luxury tax line for the NBA season is set at $ million and the Thunder s payroll after the Grant trade is down to $ million This move saved OKC about $ million dollars and puts them only at $ million above the luxury tax line The Thunder can easily shed that salary with simple other roster moves and bring themselves officially under the luxury repeater lax line How is this relevant in Russell Westbrook s case Well you can bet that prior to Grant s trade inquiring GMs will have tried to use OKC s luxury tax situation as leverage against them and lowballed on any offers But the fact that all the Thunder need to do now is shed $ million in salaries that brings back a shit ton of leverage in any negotiations OKC are no longer looking for cap relief in any potential trade so a return on any trade will likely have to include draft assets young player s and expiring or year contracts At the end of the day everyone wants to see Russ on a contender the Thunder and Russ included And I strongly believe the Thunder will indeed do right by Russ and send him to a team of his choosing But it s only because that s what Russ wants to do and not because OKC are trying to dump his salary for cap relief Russell Westbrook is a top player in the league an all NBA player in his prime and I expect plenty of teams have already reached out to Russ OKC about a potential trade And like in Paul George s case the Thunder should and absolutely will be looking to get as many assets as possible in return all salaries payroll figures taken from Spotrac ,t3_cb2wk7

The real secret to Kawhi's success,his collarbones lets take a look these things are massive and very sharp now anyone who knows anything about the human body knows that collarbones are very important and the bigger the collarbone the stronger and more powerful the shoulder this allows kawhi to take more force into his shoulder stopping it from compressing which would put the defender in an advantageous situation like so the defender gets good position here hindering kawhi With kawhis collarbones it creates more power in his shoulder which creates space for him from the defender also allowing him to push his shoulder into the defender forcing them backwards like so notice how the defender is now off balanced allowing kawhi to attack in an advantageous position now lets compare our findings to another player in the league look how tiny Caruso s collarbones are very very tiny its no wonder kawhi is so much better ,t3_cb8taz

The 7'1 Shaq vs The 5'9 Shaq: Pros and Cons of Each,Hello there Recently I posted about how tall the NBA would be if all the players stood on each other s heads I saw a comment about the Shaq and it got me thinking What advantages does the Shaq have over his taller version the Shaq Oustide of his basketball accomplishments I will look into and offer visualizations of the foot inch Shaquille O Neal Health Shaq normally stands at a height of seven feet and one inch inches However any good Redditor knows that feet inches is superior because it s actually inches Nice Also this means that Shaq is lighter Since he is shorter he s probably lighter making him only about pounds This sized Shaq is perfect for many more jobs than the Shaq such as being an astronaut But this is probably the most boring of all the possibilities Shaq has to offer Education For those who aren t aware Shaq received an MBA through the University of Phoenix online back in Chances are Shaq got this online degree on the tiny computer gifted to him by Billy Gates seen here Shaq is clearly too big to use this computer properly and he probably had a lot of trouble with it Here is the Shaq with the same computer next to Billy Gates This sized Shaq is much more compatible with the computer Gates offers He can also maintain a healthy posture while using it which could increase the amount of time he could be on his best game on the court Shaq in The Law Shaq appeared in a Miami police uniform one day to save a life On this fateful day Shaq was able to rescue Mike the Tiger from a tree he was stuck in Here is a picture of Shaq from the incident Of course his height certainly helped him make that rescue While a shorter officer s first instinct may have been to shoot mike the Tiger out of the tree Shaq has no trouble saving the animal And the long arm of the Law looks better here than the Shaq Version Shaq also swore into the Miami Police under the salary of $ a year This is grossly less than the average officer makes which seems to start at about $ k a year I believe that the department thought that they could discriminate the man because of his height and if he was they d pay him more I have no idea how this slipped under the radar but if I was Shaq I would certainly take them to court for discrimination Another experiance Shaq has in law enforcement is his help in the Safe Surfin Foundation which is made to help children avoid sexual predators However you would have a hard time tricking someone into thinking you were a year old girl if you were a foot black man and a shaq would be far better at this Here is a visualization I m not sure if you can tell but that young lady is ACTUALLY Shaq in disguise If he was a full he would never be able to pull that off Another pro to Shaq s height in law enforcement is he holds the record for the Tallest Sheriff s Deputy in Clayton County Georgia beating out the previous record holder Clevis Truckerson by a whole foot Music Shaq AKA Diesel is not only a brilliant basketball player but a fantastic rapper But his height TRULY holds him back in this industry Why Shaq s studio needs to have a custom microphone stand to catch all of his marvelous voice so he would need to make his own studio to take full advantage or go to a Big and Tall studio which he has to share with other rappers such as The Game Adding lil to your name will add a lot of influence to your name as a rapper however a Shaq cannot truly add Lil to his name as he is clearly not that Many successful music videos involve the rapper driving around or sitting in a very expensive whip such as a Ferrari or Bugatti However Shaq will be mostly restricted to G Wagons or other very large vehicles losing some street cred Shaq in a Showdown Shaq is a big man and can probably hold his own in a fight But this one goes both ways for him Shaq has a history of practicing Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and he would probably be better off at a lower height with that same build and he could be great at sports like MMA But however Shaq did end up in an altercation with The Big Show seen here But the smaller Shaq would probably have some trouble in this fight as he would be greatly outsized Here s another visualization As we can see Shaq s current height is probably good in WWE but in the UFC or boxing he might be better off at In Conclusion Your preferred flavor of Shaq really comes down to who you are as a person Myself I prefer the Shaq But there are so many opportunities Shaq possibly has missed out on throughout his life because he s not I m sure every night the man is up seeing posts about his shorter self thinking What If ,t3_cbfn9m

Would only trade Russ straight-up for a player of Luke Kennard's caliber", mins on latest podcast with Howard Beck and Rachel Nichols ZACH LOWE My somewhat lukewarm take on Russ is I wouldn t trade a single asset for him I wouldn t put Justice Winslow I wouldn t put Bam in the deal The guy I was talking to looked at me like I had heads Bam is on a rookie deal Justice is on a $ mil a year contract I wouldn t trade a first rond pick for him Unless I was in an unique situation where I needed an All Star point guard to win the championship and i dont see any teams in that situation I wouldn t trade a single asset for him I would probably only trade Luke Kennard if that was the borderline asset I had to give up Reggie Jackson isn t a assset he has net negative value Blake Griffin is an asset or at least has net neutral value I wouldn t trade Blake for him straight up on if Russ is seen as locker room friendly it s a nuanced answer I dont think he s reached that point you re asking like he s going to be an unpleasant presence in the locker room And this is a point to the Knicks I don t think you can look objectively towards the last years of the NBA and tell yourself that Russ attracts stars or be the thing that draws other stars here Because he has noy drawn stars to him Other stars have left him And maybe there are complicated factors in those decisions Maybe Kevin Durant wanted to broaden his horizons go experiment somewhere else play in another city Maybe Paul George wanted to go home to LA to play with Kawhi So maybe you can wish all of that But there s no evidence other than Paul George coming back and resigning for year that Russ is a magnet for stars HOWARD BECK so maybe I wasn t on board with this take but there was alot of talk last summer that Paul George chose Westbrook over LeBron I think it was some different things over some things Some of it had to do with comfort I don t think he literally choose Russ over Lebron But you cant say that he didn t It s part of it You cant say that he didn t It s part of it So if you say he choose Russ over Lebron then he effectively just choose Kawhi over Russ just now ZACH LOWE Yes i guess BECK because it s more that just coming home He could ve came home a year ago Maybe it was years of playing with RUss Maybe he feels differently about it I m not going to mind read him about that I know that was a consideration when KD left It wasn t the whole thing but it was alot of it I reported it at the time and have no reason to deviate fro it Zach Lowe on Westbrook s OCD practice habits such as opening gym at certain time parking his car in certain spot cutting his sandwich a certain way behavior towards media ZACH LOWE on if another team will accommodate Westbrook s habits Accommodate is an interesting word It s an accurate word A stronger version of that may be enable And look it s not made up I reported it last year It s all on the record from Scott Brooks Billy Donovan Nick Collison Andre Roberson and lots of other people From on we have to change the way we play offensively We cannot play offense this way We need more motion more passing more ball movement x y and z And it was aimed at Russ They changed the coaches they changed the stars they changed the supporting cast Nothing ever changed and they keep bumping into this hard ceiling There s only one reason they play this way And it s Russ And it s not bad He s a very good player I voted him All NBA rd team this year But there s clearly a hard ceiling they cant get past But I don t know I m not going to go on about this Russ thing I m very interested to see if and when they trade him What they get back Because if they came to me and said hey we want two st round picks one st round pick and a young player hard hard pass Come back to me when you re ready to have a real conversation ,t3_cb8fta

Russ and Harden's recruitment stories and how they were almost teammates in college,It s pretty common to know that Russ committed to UCLA after Farmar However these two were almost teammates at ASU Herb Sendek who was Harden s ASU coach tried to recruit Russ to ASU as well gt Sendek I was hired in early April and Russell was one of the very few available players so I made a trip to Leuzinger High School in Los Angeles and watched him work out It was just like an open gym with his coach at the time Reggie Morris gt Sendek At that point the workout was the only opportunity we were going to have to see him It wasn t like he was going to play any more games or play on a club team that spring It was literally over It was on the precipice of decision time Russ wasn t that heavily recruited and he wasn t even on an AAU team The only chances scouts got to see him play were during his time at Leuzinger High School gt Antwi Atuahene former ASU guard I was his host when he came down I remember speaking to Coach Sendek and assistant coach Archie Miller and they were extremely high on this guy saying how he was going to be the next great player and I didn t know who he was Usually I know who all the younger guys are but he wasn t heavily recruited Russell was really easy going He wore a white T shirt and blue jeans He was asking questions about the college and campus and how we liked it I remember he asked about how hard we work in the weight room That was the first time anyone had asked me a question on a visit about how hard we work in the weight room To be honest with a new coach in Herb Sendek we didn t even have a feel for exactly how we were going to play but he didn t even ask about that It was like he knew he was going to play regardless no matter where he was going He had that confidence He wouldn t say it out loud but how it came off was I don t care where I go I m going to be a star anyways Leaving the visit it sounded to me that he loved everything about Arizona State He loved the campus He got along with the guys going out to dinner We played a little bit and he watched us play We went out to a party Everything was really really good I thought he was going to come He basically told me before he left this is the No position right now It all changed when UCLA waited for a decision from guards Arron Afflalo and Jordan Farmar who considered early entry into the NBA Draft Perhaps as a backup plan not long after Westbrook s ASU visit Howland offered Westbrook a scholarship Russ ended up going to UCLA mainly because Farmar had committed to the NBA draft He didn t end up playing much his freshman season at UCLA but burst onto the scene in his nd year there Harden on the other hand was heavily recruited out of high school He was a five star prospect and an LA kid looking for a welcoming home gt While he played at Artesia High in Los Angeles future NBA All Star James Harden made coach Scott Pera a promise He told him that if he ever landed a big time college job he would follow him to that school As it turned out that place was Arizona State June st Herb Sendek hired Scott Pera as basketball operations director Pera would later move up and become an assistant coach Herb Sendek had already kept an eye on the star prospect gt Sendek already had a relationship with Harden He actually had started recruiting him during his final season at North Carolina State He knew hiring Pera certainly helped but he also knew nothing was final There was nothing guaranteed said Sendek today coaching at Santa Clara In fact several months elapsed It s not like everybody deferred to us once we hired Scott and said OK you can have James He was a very heavily recruited player We had to recruit him and ultimately make him and his mom comfortable with the opportunity and the fit and all those things Not only did ASU pursue Harden but so did UCLA The coach at the time Ben Howland regretted not recruiting Harden enough gt Two other Pac schools Washington and UCLA were in hot pursuit of Harden Washington was the main threat UCLA was a distant third something that bothers former coach Ben Howland to this day That s one of the big disappointments of my career not doing a better job recruiting him said Howland So not only could the two have been teammates at ASU there was a chance that they might have been teammates at UCLA Since Russ was a year older than Harden Russ might have potentially been Harden s host and the two could have shared a backcourt earlier than their OKC days Herb Sendek did a much better job recruiting Harden by signing Derek Glasser a point guard at Artesia and a close Harden friend A year older than Harden Glasser was set to walk on at USC until the Sun Devils without a point guard on their roster offered a scholarship Glasser eventually became ASU s career assists leader gt They had a tremendous connection in high school Scott Pera ASU assistant coach said They were inseparable when I was driving them back and forth to Derek s house and to different events And James is a smart guy he knew Derek was a pass first point guard gt After a short time Pera told Harden that he could accomplish anything he wanted at ASU that the program had everything he needed Harden committed Aug informing Sendek while the coach was in Hawaii They went on their separate paths only to meet again

Can you circumvent the Stepien rule like this?,If you don t know the Stepien rule doesn t allow a team to not have their draft pick in two consecutive years For example when Dallas traded Porzingis to the Knicks they attached first rounders but since their pick was already going to the Hawks they had make the picks to the Knicks be the and picks keeping years in between each outgoing pick If the protection on the Hawks pick kicked in top then the Mavs would instead give their pick to Atlanta in deferring the Knicks picks to and because of the Stepien rule For this reason the Mavs have basically no first round draft assets to trade until two years after the last pick goes to the Knicks from the KP deal But hypothetically I imagine it wouldn t be a violation of the Stepien rule if we drafted a player let s say in and then traded them as we technically still had our draft pick we traded the drafted player not the pick itself So could teams who are handicapped by the Stepien rule make handshake trades with other teams Ex Dallas trades a first round pick to OKC for Danilo Gallinari But since we can t actually trade the pick until after the draft and the other team has to get value back we include the draft rights to some year old European cash considerations or one of those top protected second round picks and then when the draft comes around we draft the player OKC wants and then trade them for basically nothing back like draft rights cash or second round pick that won t convey as I mentioned earlier Dallas would basically be bound to the agreement unless they wanted to ruin their reputation to the other teams in the league basically Would this be possible or is there some sort of restriction ,t3_cbl6ik

A new approach to the supermax problem: Front-Loaded Contracts, quick edit yes I realize the current CBA doesn t allow this It s a suggestion to change things The biggest issue with the CP Blake or Westbrook contracts is the tail end those players will be well into their thirties but exactly at this point they get paid mil dollars They aren t worth it by that point it cripples their teams ability to field a contender and it s a bad look all around But what if instead of that the contract was front loaded That way if you want to pay your superstar he gets mil on the first year when he s when he s on etc That way he still gets the same amount of money but instead of becoming this liability in his later years he can still be a major part of the team and lead them on to success This option really allows players to age gracefully and stay with the franchises they shone with in their prime years without taking massive discounts like Dirk or Duncan used to take so the team could be competitive ,t3_cbjrpr

Phoenix may surprise some people...hopefully,The suns were the worst team in pt last season In the draft we picked up two of the best point shooters in the draft with Cam Johnson and Ty Jerome In Free Agency we picked up Ricky Rubio Dario Saric Frank Kaminsky and Aron Baynes Deandre Ayton is going to THRIVE with all the space he s going to have and with Ricky Rubio feeding him He could have a HUGE step up this year after coming off of an impressive rookie year Devin Booker has improved every single year and with better players more space and having another ball handler on the team can only help him I m hoping the Suns surprise a lot of other teams and their fans Hopefully by the end of the season we are no longer one of the laughing stocks of the NBA and for everyone to see were on the rise hopefully The Suns seem to always find a way to let us down but I m going to stay optimistic This is an entirely new team and I am excited to see how they do this new year ,t3_cba0f9
The NBA is the only major sport where players can be bigger than the team,It s very well documented that the NBA is a star driven league However I believe this is an issue that many underrate in regards to the popularity of the NBA The NBA has always marketed its stars over teams but I do not believe this will always be sustainable I also want to be clear that this in no way places any blame on the players exercising their power A major appeal of sports is that the players in the jersey represent the people in the stands hence the many nicknames that are born out if successful teams We the North Showtime Lakers Bad Boy Pistons Grit N Grind Grizzlies Heatles All these nicknames inherently represent the city in some way in terms of lifestyle or attitude This is how to create a strong team fan base The issue with insane player power arises when the player is clearly bigger than the market LeBron was worth so much to the Cavs and Cleveland he basically influenced their every move the second time around Anthony Davis and Kawhi both explicitly wanted out both to a specific destination greatly reducing their teams chances of maximizing value AD got there directly and Kawhi indirectly No fan wants to believe their team is a stepping stone I know there is a lot of talk of big market vs small market and how the media portrays certain teams but the truth is of the top players in the NBA have moved to LA NY this offseason Top tier players do in fact want to play in big markets If fans in certain markets believe they are feeder teams in which they breed the stars for bigger markets to pluck away that means fewer and fewer people in the seats watching on tv buying merch etc There aren t really too many instances in other sports where players can hold teams hostage like in the NBA In the NFL we saw the Giants my team unfortunately and the Steelers trade away their star WRs They can get away with that cause they are cornerstone franchises and the NFL is a team owner driven league The fans will always support The Mariners traded Cano to the Mets after a decent season and there was no huge fan backlash Small market teams hold much more power in other sports NFL franchise tag than in the NBA This is surely something that will be addressed in the next CBA How exactly it gets done is yet to be seen ,t3_cbidk1

"In Game 7 of the 1994 NBA Finals, John Starks shot 2-18 and 0-11 from 3 point range in a 6 point loss.",I saw the Hakeem post and without discounting his achievements I want to say that this loss in the Finals is almost as gut wrenching and inconcievable as the Rockets going a year ago It also makes a lot more sense given it s the Knicks The statistical probabilities of a shooter of his calibre bricking are higher than you d think he shot from that year the chance he makes less than of the s is around but it gets worse when you realise shooters normally realise they re cold and stop shooting There have only been players in NBA history who ve gone or worse from As you d expect of these are from or later Steph and Harden have each but given they jack them up so often they d probably have a higher chance of achieving this brickfest Same goes for Brook Fresno Dirk Lopez Trey Burke Knicks legend also went before his MVP year back in Salt Lake City Antoine Walker rounds off the non Knicks list but from what I ve heard he was Andrew Bynum before Andrew Bynum so that s understandable Also Starks did this in before millennials had ruined basketball by trying to score more points instead of grinding on other men getting physical in the post Ffs only guys in the entire SEASON ever managed to get up s in a game compared to now Why are Cameron Payne and Rajon Rondo shooting s that much And since when did Rondo become capable of hitting in a game It s amazing that he wasn t given a benching to get his mind right but tbf the Knicks probably couldn t afford to go deeper into the rotation even for a few minutes Side note it really bothers me that people use the Bulls continually beating the Knicks in the s as proof that Ewing was shit Ewing never had a teammate anywhere near Pippen s calibre All in all even if the Rockets were worthywinners the fact that the Knicks found such an inventive way to lose this Finals is pitiful and I wasn t even fucking alive Knicks fan rule discover the horrors of the past to convince yourself the future is fine I blame OJ tbh TLDR Arya Stark was clutch Tony Stark was clutch John Starks wasn t Disclaimer John Starks seems like a sound guy I don t hate him or anything This was just an awful day at the office and I m so glad he didn t have to suffer u bootum lowlights,t3_cb7eho
Expanding the PG trade for a center - a [LAC/OKC/HOU] trade idea,Everyone is assuming Houston is talking to OKC about Westbrook but what about a team trade between these three with Houston obtaining Gallinari OKC trades George $ mil OKC acquires Gilgeous Alexander Eric Gordon draft picks mil LAC trades Gallinari Gilgeous Alexander Harrell $ mil Add in LAC st to OKC for Capela LAC acquires George Capela $ mil HOU trades Capela Gordon $ mil HOU acquires Gallinari Harrell mil it can be boiled down to LAC gets Capela HOU gets Gallinari OKC gets an extra st Advanced analytics loves Gallinari I could see Morey wanting him credit to u Marcheesio for the initial idea of involving Capela and the format Why would LAC trade Harrell for Capela Harrell is currently in a contract year and will likely be getting a bigger contract next year Capela is locked up coincidentally around the same amount of time that Kawhi and PG are Capela is also a better rim defender than Harrell which is something that the Clippers need more than another post up playmaker when they are already putting their faith in Zubac ,t3_cbizmc

[Serious] What do you make of the Cavs for this upcoming season?,The Cavs have an interesting season coming up You can basically split the team into two groups Group The Young Core Larry Nance Jr Darius Garland Collin Sexton Cedi Osman Ante Zizic Dylan Windler Kevin Porter Jr Nance is a little older but is entering the first year of an extension so that fits him much more into this group than the second one I think Nance will move to the starting center spot either once we can find a new home for Tristan Thompson or before Garland and Sexton will probably start the year as the starting back court There are many who feel they won t mesh well based on play styles Others think that Beilein s offensive system will help alleviate that As the two top draft picks the last two years how this plays out will speak volumes to the team s immediate future Cedi Osman will likely start on the wing This will be a big year for him as he enters restricted free agency next summer Zizic really impressed me personally I didn t expect much but he certainly exceeded those expectations I think he s earned the backup center minutes even in our crowded front court Windler and Porter Jr Will come off the bench I think Porter Jr could be brought along slowly and then given a bigger role once a few trades are made throughout the year Group The trade chips Tristan Thompson yr Brandon Knight yr Jordan Clarkson yr Matthew Dellavadova yr John Henson yr That s a real rag tag group of expirings I think we could get decent value for TT and Clarkson and Delly if we were willing to deal him Delly is a crowd favorite The others have little to no value as players so we d have to look for teams looking to clear cap space for free agency or to shed salary to find value Unless the Cavs have free agency aspirations of their own but that seems unlikely Straddling both these groups is Kevin Love who is going into the first season of a yr million extension The Cavs fully intend to trade him at some point during this deal but are in no rush to do so His contract only gets better as time goes on so they have the luxury to see if he can get back on the court and increase his value with his play Just staying on the court for a prolonged stretch will be the first hurdle he has to clear The Cavs are not likely to win many games next year I d project them personally around wins Who will start and finish games for the Cavs How many wins will they have How many games will Kevin Love play for them Who will be traded this upcoming season ,t3_cbm9gh

Some thoughts from a bystander,The NBA is awesome and free agency has been exciting I m no expert but i try keep tabs on what s happened Here are my thoughts would love to open a discussion on them I m not sold on the Utah Jazz hype train Conley is good an All Star even if he wasn t recognised as one But is he a number one option on a championship contender If he s your best and Donovan Mitchell is your second option you are at a talent deficit at the top Bogdanovic is a nice signing and he will be able to soak up minutes at power forward Yet somehow methinks they lack a true alpha to win big Maybe packaging Bojan on a movable along with Exum or mudiay could bring an upgrade That still wouldn t solve the problem The grizzlies had Conley as their number one option and peak Gasol is better than current Mitchell They made the conference finals once in and were swept Teams today may not have Tim Duncan but the Paul George Kawhi Leonard duos are going to pack firepower and experience The Jazz are unique in this sense They are going to defend their arses off and bank on their collective ability to buy them buckets Maybe it will work but until we hit April and May consider me a skeptic Milwaukee deserve more credit for how they handled their free agents so far As disheartening as it must ve been to lose how they did they had a championship team last year who won games They lost to the eventual champs How great they were can often be forgotten in scenarios like these hawks spring to mind The Bucks retained of their key free agents and signed RoLo and Wesley Mathews at good value Losing Brogdon will hurt especially his shooting and off the catch attacking In many ways he was a better option than Bledsoe But retaining him was always going to be difficult million a season is an overpay even for a low volume year old It would ve left the Bucks with no space to do anything really and permanently locked themselves into a core that hadn t actually reached the Finals Middleton on a max is also a slight overpay but a necessary one They couldn t let him walk and couldn t risk lowballing him and losing him all together In my uninformed view he s underrated He s an elite shooter a multi faceted scorer can guard multiple positions and is steady in the playoffs He also checks out of games at times and is not a standard number They should be favourites in the East regardless The Warriors acquisition of Russell surprised everyone The consensus seems to be they will trade him at some point for a better fit around their Big There is a slight irony to that idea It cost them Iguodala and in a sense Livingston to acquire Russell Both of these players fit the Warriors style Hell they made the Warriors style They flipped people who fit for someone who didn t who they will likely use to flip for more players who fit It made sense to shed Iguodala and Livingston Both are old declining and on larger contracts than they are worth What makes less sense to me anyways is why everyone is so willing to flip Russell He s a year old All Star on a fair contract He plays Curry s position which won t matter a lot this year with Thompson out And long term may be better as Curry ages The temptation for Golden State may be to sell low for short term help to the foundational stars And because as Thompson s return approaches GSW will probably lose some leverage They wouldn t need Russell But what could they get Timberwolves seem a likely candidate but what do thy have to offer I can t see Robert Covington Teague on an expiring and some combination of picks getting it done Even if Bob Myers has a hard on for Brad Beal the Wiz have no need at point guard and a SG doesn t fit any better than Russell My point is those whom rush to demand a Russell trade have to watch what is even available or where it leaves Golden State Those on the Golden State bandwagon aren t known for watching much outside of June anyway It feels like there are very distinct tiers in the East now Philly and the Bucks are likely to be dominant for the first time in what feels like an eternity the best team in the league may be in the East The Bucks have the MVP and continuity Philly have under two way monsters Boston Toronto and the Nets are a tier below Kemba is a slight downgrade on the flat earther and no kanter moustache can replace Al Horford But they are still deep on talent and have a top coach in the league The Nets will have growing pains but we all know they are going to be good even without KD Toronto are an interesting case They have above average starting point guard Spicy P and big Spain But OG and Norm are their best wings which is slightly frightening Their depth reliable for years feels shallow I just can t put the champs below second tier for now Beyond those five who takes the remaining playoff spots will be interesting Or at least as interesting as a slap fight can get If Miami get Westbrook they could be top One of Detroit Orlando Miami and Indiana are going to miss If I had to pick it would be a Russless Miami by a hair Speaking of Russ PG did him dirty Everyone knows that He literally chose Kawhi over him and in doing so sentenced OKC to a rebuild But a rebuild was likely coming anyway Did fans really want conference final exits for years before the inevitable tear down They got an unprecedented haul Kawhi is better and younger and lifts himself in the playoffs Besides Russ doesn t even hate PG Maybe Russ knew this was the right deal for everyone I think we go with him Because he deserves it He gets a lot of love and hate on this sub But he s an all nba player and has been for close to a decade He s an all time athlete and his MVP season shall stand as one of the best ever He has never demanded to leave In a world of trade demands superstar team ups and ESPN Zion worship homegrown draft picks showing loyalty is heartwarming I could be alone but things like Brad Beal s effort last season or Blake Griffin shaking hands with the Detroit media at season end are wholesome Basketball is what they are paid for but things like that are why they deserve it Professionalism comes with the contract but class is a choice We fans sometimes forget that Would love to hear feedback ,t3_cbfkqj

Boogie or Kuzma 3PT shooting is a key for LeBron at PG system for the LA Lakers, With LeBron at PG spot Lakers are basically copying Houston and OKC experiment of delivering the ball as fast as possible to the team s best playmaker and crucial decision maker in the earliest seconds of every possession to force things while defense is not set The difference between the Rockets and the Thunder stuff were spacing and better playmaking skills by Harden While LeBron being smarter than both of them and is way more similar to Harden Rockets experiment would be a copy cat and it has a lot of sense for LBJ If a team has no solid playmaker at all there is no need to keep Rondo or a minimum or buy out guy on the floor with both of this options being barely a NBA caliber players not only championship caliber point guards overall It s safe to say that LeBron is going to defend other teams fifth option in that case you need two guys around him in his Beverley and Ariza a limited playmaking guard who can be a secondary ball handler while LeBron is heavily trapped or heavy doubled that could be trusted to run a simple on or on while Davis wouldn t be left alone by anybody situations sorry KCP but it s Avery Bradley and a deadly PT shooter who could guard both wing positions and open up himself in the corners that s basically Danny Green Davis is a pick and roll option number one and here we come to the crucial part the paint should be open on every play that s why LeBron has never shown a willingness to play with a classic center that brings help defense on his shoulders on a long term deal especially now with him and AD possibly rolling there They re not Isiah sized players So Javale is basically excluded from a starting lineup With Boogie and Kuzma left we have a battle of limited defensive players whose biggest goal should be a volume PT shooting around the arc to create spacing and receive passes while side or high pick n roll are trapped or being an option for Spanish pick n roll involving three players Cousins was good at shooting from this these positions in his three seasons prior to Achilles injury making total threes with only of them in total from the corners in years He basically lived there while he was hunting for the three point shot So if he could basically return to his shooting form All NBA caliber comeback is a delusion he can fill that role with a huge hole in his offensive game in his driving after pump fakes and attacking the rim on the catch or attacking the close out due to his obvious lack of speed and quickness Kuzma would be great at this kind of driving due to his athleticism but his perimeter game is limited and spacing is crucial for this whole system so his potentially improved PT shot gives him a chance to be a contributor on contending team despite his defense He s a non starter if he can t deliver in that regard basically The opposition defense should be honest with your game especially in that particular system The fifth starting spot should basically be taken by a more aggressive and more consistent PT shooter among those two You could have a hint on how this should be operated on this Ryan Anderson vid from Harden s PG season and realize why that s so important Lakers also should found the way to cover the lack of dribble penetration in none original PG scheme Rockets did it with Eric Gordon as a heavy loaded Sixth Man ,t3_cbell3

Unpopular Opinion: Clippers wont be as good as everyone thinks.,Well They actually will be just as good as everyone thinks BUT i dont believe theyll be healthy enough to get a top seed in the West Not when they play teams like rockets Warriors Lakers Jazz Blazers etc times each Kawhi missed games last year and its reasonable to assune he will miss around games again this year as part of his load managenent PG is already set to miss a few games at the start of the season at least Probably will get plenty of rest throughout the year too So I feel like the total amount of games theyll both be playing together should be between games Whats the chance they win every single one of those Pretty unlikely If they win games at the Warriors win percentage in games PG and Kawhi actually play together then they will get wins Obviously thats unlikely because role players like Lou Will and Bev will also be injured for at least a few games And they clearly wont lose every game that PG or Kawhi arent in But i dont think theyre as guaranteed wins that everyone seems to think theyll get I think wins should be a realistic expectation but I wouldnt be suprised to see them only get wins Now please ridicule me for my opinion Thanks ,t3_cbd2wl

[OC] Analyzing the consistency of &gt;25PPG players in 2018-19,We re getting damn close to peak offseason so I thought I d try to quantify the consistency of the top players in the NBA Who performs roughly the same every night Who suffers from wild variations in performance Scoring consistency of PPG players In this graph each game played by the players who averaged points per game is plotted The players respective overall PPG is shown in red At the top of the plot are the most consistent players as measured by the coefficient of variation This coefficient of variation is simply the standard deviation of a player s output in points divided by that player s PPG The lower the coefficient of variation the more consistent the player is In other words a player who averages PPG with a standard deviation of meaning that in a typical game they finish points away from their overall PPG is deemed to be more consistent than another player who averages PPG with a standard deviation of The coefficient of variation for each player is shown in parentheses on the y axis next to each player s name Quick statistical aside Why not simply look at standard deviation Because the standard deviation tends to be higher when the mean is higher which would make players with a very high PPG appear much more inconsistent than they really are So what can we learn from this graph There are some significant differences in consistency even for players with similar PPG averages For example while LeBron James and Steph Curry average almost exactly the same number of points and respectively the Warriors point guard is much more likely to explode for or score fewer than points At the extreme of the spectrum lies Kemba Walker who is wildly inconsistent in terms of nightly scoring In fact among PPG players since the season Kemba s season is the least consistent of all with a coefficient of variation of With an average output of points and a standard deviation of it is unsurprising to see Kemba go for or In fact Kemba scoring or less OR scoring or more occurred times last season almost rd of the games he played By comparison Bradley Beal who averaged exactly the same PPG scored between and in all but games Consistency in gamescore I also looked at the consistency of players gamescores This allows us to have a more nuanced look since it incorporates more aspects of the game rebounding turnovers etc Here is the relevant graph Included are all players who averaged a gamescore of or more Again LeBron and Kawhi appear to perform roughly the same every night while Curry is much more prone to off nights very impressive games Consistency in historical perspective How much of a difference can this make Arguably quite a bit Let s look at two extreme cases to illustrate this point As measured by gamescore using the coefficient of variation these are the most consistent seasons since only gamescore Player Season Mean gamescore SD gamescore Coefficient of variation Kevin Durant LeBron James Kevin Durant Kevin Garnett LeBron James LeBron James LeBron James Really impressive to see LeBron times on this list he has of the top most consistent seasons in gamescore since Here are the least consistent seasons in gamescore in that same timeframe minimum average gamescore of Player Season Mean gamescore SD gamescore Coefficient of variation Gilbert Arenas James Harden Kobe Bryant Jimmy Butler Amar e Stoudemire Gilbert Arenas Steph Curry For the sake of comparison let s compare Gilbert Arenas sadly historic season to a highly consistent season with a similar average gamescore LeBron s season There is only a slight difference in mean gamescore with LeBron edging Arenas by approximately However as the plot shows LeBron was remarkably consistent whereas Arenas alternated between highly productive games including the th highest gamescore in NBA history on December th and awful performances including a point for effort for a gamescore of yes that s a negative gamescore Hope this was informative and I welcome any feedback ,t3_cb6knl
[Serious] Would an anti-trade kicker be a good solution for players requesting trades?,Adam Silver just spoke about how players requesting trades needs to be addressed in some manner Would an anti trade kicker potentially work I commented about this in another thread but I figured I d just make a post for more visibility because I think the idea has potential The basic idea is that it s the opposite of a trade kicker so if a player is traded they ll lose a certain amount of money from their contract A couple of rules that would probably have to happen for this to work The anti trade kicker is accompanied by a no trade clause This would mean that players couldn t be traded from the franchise without them wanting to be traded meaning they won t lose money from the anti trade kicker unless they re the ones wanting to leave the franchise It doesn t affect the salary cap This way the team that is trading for the player doesn t get a couple million in bonus For example If a player is signed on for mil with an anti trade kicker of mil the team that traded for them would still have that mil on the cap sheet but the player only received mil It is only applicable to contracts larger than m per year I m a bit unsure about this rule but I think it makes the most sense to only allow the anti trade kicker to be applied to the big name free agents who are the ones who typically ask for trades anyway Teams can waive it This is for teams who sign a younger player with an anti trade kicker who turn out to be not worth their contract For example if Wiggins would ve signed with one the Timberwolves would probably waive his anti trade kicker in a trade since they re the ones who are attempting to move his contract not Wiggins Some things I m still unsure of about this What the amount is that this is applicable to I wrote mil in the rule I made but I m not sure mil is the right number How much exactly the anti trade kicker would be They d have to find the perfect amount to make the anti trade kicker so it still effects the player without completely obliterating their financial situation There are definitely still some problems with this that could be addressed but I think it s a good solution that would deter players from demanding a trade knowing they d lose a large amount of money Curious to see what y all think of this and what could be improved here if they decided this was the solution to players demanding trades ,t3_cbaiiq
"Kyrie once purposely avoided and ignored calls from a Cavs assistant coach who was assigned to train him. After two weeks, the coach tracked Kyrie down in Miami, where Kyrie admitted he was simply testing the coach's motives", amp x B Where was Kyrie Phil Handy was befuddled It was the summer of and Handy had just joined Mike Brown s coaching staff in Cleveland His first assignment his most important assignment was to work with Irving the No overall pick who was heading into his third NBA season Handy tried calling the number Irving had given him He tried texting He tried again Nothing For two weeks Frustrated he finally took a flight to Miami where Irving was working out to see him in person Which as it happens was what Irving wanted He was challenging me in a sense to see how I was gonna handle it says Handy who grew close to Irving in their four years together It wasn t just a smooth start This kid he was very evasive and he was doing it on purpose We laugh and joke about it now because we re well beyond it Irving s explanation was simple Handy recalls I didn t know you I had to give you another number just to keep you at bay just to see what you were gonna do The same themes run through every story from former coaches and teammates That Irving doesn t trust easily That he s guarded wary of others motives He needs to get a sense of a person before he extends a bridge Irving can come across as distant aloof The word moody is mentioned often among those who worked with him in Cleveland There were reports of him disengaging with teammates for days at a time feeding perceptions of Irving as self centered difficult or perhaps just uncomfortable in LeBron s orbit Those feelings are not universal however amp x B amp x B It s well chronicled LeBron is the captain of this team the veteran Jones says months after that Game shot The best player in the world He s our best player but Ky s our most important player He s our most dynamic player When he s locked in when he s even keeled it calms our team Bron is forceful Kyrie is calm He s precision for us LeBron s the hammer and Kyrie s the chisel Irving and LeBron found common ground to complete the game s most historic comeback and Irving used the game s biggest stage to show how deadly he could be No rocket science man we just worked Coach Handy says of Irving s development A lot of people don t know the work we put in We work on his ballhandling we work on his footwork we work on posting up we work on finishes We try to get outside of the box to keep things fresh and creative We watch film To his credit he really bought into it gt Irving wasn t always willing to hit the lab with Handy though They both say that their relationship goes beyond basketball now but things didn t start out rosy gt I came here from the Lakers Coach Handy says Kyrie and I we didn t know each other He had just gone through having Byron Scott get fired When I was there Mike Brown really wanted me to build a relationship with Kyrie and mentor him He tried to curve me a little bit gt He was spending the summer in Miami Handy continues I told Mike Brown and the Cavs Look I m going to have to get on a plane and go down to Miami and sit and talk with this kid I had a man to man talk with him and told him what I was about and what the expectations were from a level of respect and really tried to help him understand that my relationship with him was going to be built on work and trust From there we took off There was also the influence of one of the game s most legendary and fundamentally sound players ever Before the Cavs Handy was on the Lakers staff helping Kobe Bryant refine his meticulous footwork He s still close with Bean so he orchestrated a meeting between the two When I first came I told Kobe I really would like you to build a relationship with Kyrie Is it OK if he reaches out And I encouraged Ky Look man draw from him Reach out to him Talk to him His work ethic it really grew He fell in love with working on his game and the success that comes from it He s taken a lot from Kobe Thanks to Handy Irving was able to finally advance the area of his skill set that needed the most help Now when he dribbles his feet cut move and stop exactly where he wants them to He has the ability to land on the same spot out of times His hands move like lightning but it s the feet that set up his famous crossovers His footwork needed some work back in the day says Micah Lancaster a pro hoops trainer who worked with Irving when he was coming out of Duke and during the early part of his career That was the area that I think he had natural abilities in some ways He had a great feel for the game but it was the area he probably needed to improve on the most ,t3_carv59
[OC] How Every Team Could Trade For Russell Westbrook, IMPORTANT I think the majority of these hypotheticals are dumb and that s mainly because of how difficult it is to trade a star PG Before you go NEPHEW NEPHEW horrible trade idea I would likely agree with you Personally I don t think Westbrook will be traded and I don t think they should Anyways here is some nonsense ATLANTA RECEIVES Russell Westbrook OKC RECEIVES st Round Cavs Pick Protected st Round Hawks Pick Swap Worst with ATL John Collins Chandler Parsons Why Imagine Westbrook playing with shooters everywhere The Hawks backcourt would be Westbrook running the point and Trae Young playing as an off ball combo guard Huerter would be placed at the and Reddish and Hunter would be playing the forwards This small ball lineup would defensively be horrendous but produce one of the difficult to stop defensively The Hawks would be able to afford a max contract slot in to pair with the Young Hawks and Westbrook but if I were them I d sign Millsap and Marc Gasol on one year deals OKC will get a guy averaging in John Collins who replaces the loss of Jerami Grant and getting the expiring contract of Chandler Parsons The assets they receive will likely be two second round draft picks if the Cavs escape the top picks it would be a miracle and a mid future st rounder but gaining Collins and cap space is worth it BOSTON RECEIVES Russell Westbrook OKC RECEIVES Marcus Smart Gordon Hayward Guerchon Yabusele Memphis st Round Protected Milwaukee st Round Protected Why Some people think that Westbrook and Walker don t pair well together because they are both ball dominant guards who in order to be successful they need to be the primary ball handler Uhhhhhh have you not watched the NBA All Star game Team LeBron stood no chance Boston would have on paper one of the most talented teams in the NBA Having a big three around Westbrook Walker and Tatum while still have Jaylen Brown and Enes Kanter would be tremendous Boston also dumps the disgusting contract of Gordon Hayward and is essentially shipping away a late lottery pick and the th pick of the draft OKC receives former Oklahoma State superstar Marcus Smart who will at least be loved by the fans The backcourt of Shai and Smart would create a very nice defensive backcourt and having Hayward and Schroder manning the bench lineup is solid Yabsule is Zion in Sandals and a winter coat with a dress shirt underneath but is a PF the Thunder need on roster OKC also getting the Memphis pick can get themselves a potential unprotected Memphis Lotto pick in if the Memphis pick falls past BROOKLYN RECEIVES Russell Westbrook OKC Receives DeAndre Jordan Caris LaVert Joe Harris Spencer Dinwiddie Brooklyn st Round Unprotected Brooklyn st Round Top Protected Why Imagine OKC with instead of Young Harden Westbrook Durant big you had Kyrie instead On paper the team would be filthy Westbrook has two iso scorers to pass to and the drive and kicks will be hard for any team to keep up with Maintaing Kurucus and Allen gives them a solid enough starting lineup as Durant nurses his injury Prince will be thrown in the starting lineup as well as play sixth man during the absence Claxton Jaylen Hands have All NBA Rookie rd Team Potential The NBPA will be pretty mad DAJ gets traded after sacrificing to play on a contender and he will be traded out of OKC Harris and Dinwiddie as well as the very talented LaVert The picks will be in the s region likely but the cap space they will be able to free and the tank can finally start CHARLOTTE RECEIVES Russell Westbrook Steven Adams OKC Receives Nicholas Batum Michael Kidd Gilchrist Bismack Biyombo Charlotte st Round Unprotected Charlotte st Round Unptotected Charlotte st Round Top Protected Why Michael Jordan realizes that he could create the best team of dunkers the NBA has possibly seen Westbrook Monk Bridges would honestly make me nbastr I mean league pass some Hornets games Their fastbreaks would be insane Charlotte becomes a playoff contender and honestly could go to the Eastern Semis Having a stretch like Marvin Williams will expand Westbrook s ability to help the team As Monk Washington and Bacon future MIP progress the Hornets will be a future ECF contender If Rozier can return to Scary Terry form it s bad news OKC taking on the horrendous contracts and getting assets will be best for them Embracing the tank so they can eventually draft the savior James Wiseman CHICAGO RECEIVES Russell Westbrook OKC RECEIVES Otto Porter Jr Kris Dunn st Round Unprotected st Round Top Protected Why The Bulls young core will be gunning for playoff experience and will show flashes of being a top seed at times Taking the load off of LaVine allows him to shine like he did in earlier parts of the season Coby White will get a chance to develop in a more comfortable postion instead of being forced to carry a larger role OKC gets more cap free for the free agency by taking on Otto Porter Kris Dunn is a talented young Point guard OKC can look to build on if Shai doesn t succeed future st that have potential of jumping in the lottery is a good investment for them to build on CLEVELAND RECEIVES Russell Westbrook Steven Adams OKC RECEIVES Darius Garland Smith Tristan Thompson Cavs st Round Unprotected Cavs st Round Unprotected Cavs st Round Top Protected Why Cleveland who can t move Kevin Love decide to pair him with the UCLA alum in a last ditch effort of making a Cavs playoff run Westbrook and Sexton will be the most energetic backcourt in basketball and having shooters like Love Cedi Windler will benefit Love tremendously OKC would love to take on the expiring contracts of and Tristan and couldn t be accused of tanking when they can t play Garland because he is already nursing an injury DALLAS RECEIVES Russell Westbrook OKC RECEIVES Tim Hardaway Jr Courtney Lee Mavericks st Round Unprotected Mavericks st Round Unprotected Why Dallas is going to gun for that seed that is in contention with Sacramento and San Antonio Westbrook can take Dallas to the playoffs and beyond The Big of Westbrook Doncic and KP will be a nightmare for defenses Westbrook and Doncic are both elite playmakers and Porzingis will space the floor and be a monster on the glass The future unprotected picks for Dallas could potentially be lottery picks if Westbrook declines hard or KP is cursed with injuries Adding Courtney Lee expiring and Tim Hardaway Jr will be nice veteran presences to help lead the tank DENVER RECEIVES Russell Westbrook OKC RECEIVES Gary Harris Mason Plumlee Michael Porter Jr Denver st Round Unprotected Denver st Round Unprotected Why Murray who is not known for being a great playmaker but know as being an elite scorer and could be paired with one of the best playmakers in basketball in Russell Westbrook Russ and Jokic would spread the ball around beautifully and Murray would get open shots for days OKC gains a piece they can build next to in Gary Harris and have the high reward potential Michael Porter Jr posses Plumlee expires and would fill the starting center role if they decide to move Adams The future assets will help OKC build a solid team in the future DETROIT RECEIVES Russell Westbrook Abdel Nader OKC RECEIVES Reggie Jackson Luke Kennard Tony Snell Khyri Thomas st Round Unprotected st Round Unprotected Why Detroit has very sneaky depth and can afford to lose young assets while still having an elite bench Detroit s new big three will be the best trio in the league when healthy Svi will step up big time this year and looks to be one of the best players at Summer League Bruce Brown shown tremendous improvement throughout last year and Detroit will have a gem in Sekou Dombouya Detroit would be willing to give away future picks in an attempt to gun for a top seed in the East OKC taking on the expiring Jackson will give them an above average PG if they don t want to trade Adams and acquiring guards Khyri Thomas and Luke Kennard will give them a nice future backcourt to work with and throw in a lineup with Schroder Two first round future picks is always nice for a rebuilding team GOLDEN STATE RECEIVES Russell Westbrook Steven Adams Clippers st Round Unprotected Clippers st Round Unprotected OKLAHOMA CITY RECEIVES Steph Curry Draymond Green Why Only trade that works financially Because the Oakland Warriors are retiring they need to create a new image in San Fransisco OKC accepts the burden of Steph Curry FREEFLACKO HOUSTON RECEIVES Russell Westbrook Patrick Patterson OKC RECEIVES Chris Paul Issac Hartenstein Houston st Round Unprotected Houston st Round Unprotected Houston st Round Unprotected Houston st Round Top Protected Why Houston reunites Harden and Westbrook creating the best backcourt in the NBA Westbrook s fast style of play fits well in D Antoni s system and knock on wood he is way more durable than Paul OKC will have to try to deal out Paul as someone as competitive as CP would not want to be tank commander The roster with Paul would be interesting as CP Adams and Gallinari are all chippy fiery competitors Defensively they would be in the upper echelon of the league The future assets they would receive would be enough to lose Westbrook INDIANA RECEIVES Russell Westbrook OKC RECEIVES Myles Turner Warren Aaron Holiday Pacers st Round Top Protected Why Indiana now is equipped with Russ s former teammates Oladipo and Lamb Lamb is a knockdown shooter that pairs well with Russ and Oladipo is a great secondary ball handler off the wing If Oladipo recovers well with less attention on him he could be able to dominate Brogdon off the bench would allow either Westbrook or Oladipo to rest comfortably Sabonis will look to be their starting or would be able to play the if McMillian chooses to start Goga OKC gains a lot of young talent that makes it so they don t necessarily need to tank With Myles Turner the Thunder can trade away Adams for either another wing they could use and a future draft pick s CLIPPERS RECEIVE Russell Westbrook Thunder Receive Landry Shamet Mo Harkless Jerome Robinson Sindarius Thornwell Luc Mbah Moute LAC st Round Unprotected MIA st Round Unprotected Tobias Harris Sam Dekker Trade Exceptions Why Creating a god squad that would put its big brother to shame would be great I can t picture Westbrook and Paul George playing together but they both fit well next to Kawhi This team would have some holes to fill depth wise but the starting lineup rivals Golden State OKC getting that Miami draft pick could be huge due to the uncertainty of Dragic and Butler s future with the team and the weak upcoming free agency class that Dragic is in Landry Shamet is a great young guard that will stay on contract and I have a lot of faith in Jerome Robinson s potential LAKERS RECEIVE Russell Westbrook THUNDER RECEIVE LeBron James Why Only trade that works financially LeBron is terrfied of earthquakes FREEFLACKO MEMPHIS RECEIVES Russell Westbrook Terrence Ferguson OKC RECEIVES Josh Jackson Kyle Anderson Grayson Allen Brandon Clarke Miles Plumlee Memphis st Round Unprotected Memphis st Round Unprotected Why Ja Morant and Westbrook have similar playstyles and what if Ja could learn from his predecessor The Grizzlies would be a very good fit for Westbrook because they will have great spacing due to JVal and JJJ being able to hit the tre This team will be able to play multiple positions and be great at switching Crowder JJJ Iggy Having Ja Brooks Dwight and Crowder off the bench makes their team significantly deep and Memphis could gun at even a seed OKC gains Josh Jackson who I believe can still be a star in the league Brandon Clarke one of college s best shot blockers and finishers gives OKC a starting and they can take on Miles Plumlee s contract Anderson can fill a solid role MIAMI RECEIVES Russell Westbrook OKC RECEIVES Goran Dragic Bam Abadeyo James Johnson Heat st Round Pick Unprotected Heat st Round Pick Swap Worst Why Westbrook already has spacing on this team from Waiters Herro and the floor spacing bigs of Kelly Olynyk and Meyers Legend Westbrook and Butler will both motivate their team to succeed and could push the Heat to an ECF visit OKC has Dragic on a one year deal and he s a good PG if they want to retain him Bam Adebayo is a great athlete who has shown moments of being a dominant rebounder and shot blocker and could be a great starting if the Team decides to trade Adams James Johnson fills the teams need at four for the next two years MILWAUKEE RECEIVES Russell Westbrook Terrance Ferguson OKC RECEIVES Khris Middleton DJ Wilson Donte DiVencenzo Milwaukee st Round Draft Pick Unprotected Why Only trade that works financially besides switching Middleton with Antetekounmpo This again is one of the only trades that financially can happen If Westbrook or Giannis gets a defensive rebound the fast break that ensures will be unstoppable The Westbrook To Antetekounmpo lobs will be a thing of beauty and they will destroy any center under the hoop OKC would have their franchise piece in Middleton and get young assets in DJ Wilson and DiVencenzo MINNESOTA RECEIVES Russell Westbrook Andre Roberson OKC RECEIVES Andrew Wiggins Jeff Teague Gorgui Dieng Minnesota st Round Unprotected Minnesota st Round Top Protected Why Minnesota finally sheds that monster contract of Wiggins and allows Towns to play with a true elite point guard Westbrook will have Okogie and Covington as his wings who will allow him to rest on defense as he can guard now the second best guard on offense Jordan Bell will be an excellent cutter off the pick and roll Off the bench Jarret Culver can space the floor for Russ and create his own shot when Russ can t get it to fall down Jake Layman also is a top lob catcher in the NBA OKC would take on the expiring Teague and build around Wiggins Wiggins in another environment could be the Andrew Wiggins that people envisioned him to be back in Dieng is a serviceable replacement if the Thunder try to trade Dieng away NEW ORLEANS RECEIVES Russell Westbrook OKC RECEIVES Lonzo Ball Josh Hart E Twaun Moore Darius Miller Jason Smith New Orleans st Round Pick Unprotected New Orleans st Round Pick Unprotected Why New Orleans would have a very athletic lineup of Westbrook Holiday Ingram Zion Hayes They still hold knockdown shooter JJ Redick and Davis Bertans off the bench as well as the dynamic prospect Nickel Alexander Walker OKC would get a load of expiring contracts and most importantly their franchise PG in Lonzo Ball Josh Hart is another young guy that will keep the rebuilding process positive as well as being able to develop into a better playmaker NEW YORK If you trade every eligible Knicks player to OKC all they can afford is Steven Adams and Patrick Patterson ORLANDO RECEIVES Russell Westbrook OKC RECEIVES Evan Fournier DJ Augustin Markelle Fultz Orlando st Round Draft Pick Unprotected Orlando st Round Draft Pick Unprotected Why Orlando with an elite PG like Westbrook could create some serious damage The Magic have failed to place an all star next to Vucevic and it would be a shame if they wasted his prime Ross Issac Gordon are all freaks of nature that still haven t hit their peak and with Westbrook this team has potential to go to the ECF Off the bench the Magic still have MCW Iwundu Frazier and we still don t know how good Bamba can be Markelle Fultz is the perfect PG to have when you need someone to command your tank If he can get past his mental obstacles and physical pain he could bounce back and be the two way star that we envisioned him to be out of college Fournier is a good guard to have in the future that fits in most offenses as well as a good future trade piece Augustin is also a solid PG that is on a one year deal that you can resign for cheap PHILADELPHIA RECEIVES Russell Westbrook LAC st Round Pick Unprotected OKC RECEIVES Joel Embiid Zhaire Smith Jonah Bolden Why Embiid is required to make this trade financially work In this scenario Philly would have two ball dominant guards in Simmons Westbrook and have Richardson Harris stretching the floor Horford is more effective as a than a so overall Philly s spacing improves OKC is ready to make Embiid their franchise player making it so they Adams for supporting pieces immediately Zhaire Smith is an interesting process who could end up like a pre injury Iman Shumpert PHOENIX RECEIVES Russell Westbrook OKC RECEIVES Mikael Bridges Tyler Johnson Aron Baynes Ty Jerome Phoenix st Round Unprotected Phoenix st Round Unprotected Phoenix st Round Unprotected Why The Suns in real life would think that trading Westbrook for Booker Ayton and Saric would be a win for them but in this dream fantasy where the Suns are competent this isn t terrible for them Rubio is a good all around guard and Westbrook plays somewhat similar to Donovan Mitchell so they would work fine Booker would be playing at the win Saric would be at the and Ayton can play down low If they retain Oubre they still have a decent bench with Okobo Korver another shooter for Russ Jevon Carter and Kaminsky Booker wants to be on a team that can win and this roster would definitely put them in a spot to reach the seed OKC would be given a high amount of future draft picks from one of the least successful franchises in Major sports They would have Baynes who would be good to have if you want to tank and trade away Adams They also get Mikael Bridges who is sneakily one of the best defenders in the NBA along with the Exipiring contract of Tyler Johnson PORTLAND RECEIVES Russell Westbrook OKLAHOMA CITY RECEIVES CJ McCollum Zach Collins Portland st Round Pick Lottery Protected Why There s really no reason to make this trade In this scenario Neil Olshey goes clubbing with Lamar Odom and thinks he sees the light Westbrook and Lillard are the two hardest competitors in the league and maybe in this alternate reality Westbrook plays hard but is in a situation where he feels he can take less shots OKC gets a really good shooting guard for two year and a young PF C in Zach Collins they can build by Adams SACRAMENTO RECEIVES Russell Westbrook OKC st Round Pick Unprotected OKC nd Round Pick Unprotected LAC st Round Pick Unprotected OKC RECEIVES De Aaron Fox Marvin Bagley III Bogdan Bogdonavic Caleb Swannigan Nemanja Biejencia Why This trade also has no business taking place Westbrook Buddy Hield and Harrison Barnes fit well with each other and could land a max slot in the Free Agency The Kings would definitely lose some of their identity but them getting a ton of draft picks would numb the pain OKC would love to take the Young core of the Kings and most teams would sell even more to have what they have going Billy Donovan would love to try to play Bagley at the and Swannigan at the three SAN ANTONIO RECEIVES Russell Westbrook OKC RECEIVES DeMar DeRozan Patty Mills Lonnie Walker IV Why The Spurs have a great roster to surround Westbrook with They have sharpshooters like Forbes and Bellenelli as well as quality wings in Rudy Gay and DeMarre Carroll The Spurs are already loaded at PG now that Dejounte Murray returns as well as Derrick White Of course Aldridge can benefit from another guy who can get hot and score and Aldridge will got lot of freebies from Westbrook s aggressive drives I would love to see what Pop could bring out of Russ Tony Parker too played reckless but Pop got him to harness it and make him a hall of famer Westbrook is about x the athlete and could do even more damage OKC gets a great asset in DeMar DeRozan who can be a key role on a successful team if they build around Adams or a future trade asset Lonnie Walker is a great prospect who can do it all and is a really intelligent guy that would bring positive energy during a rebuild Patty Mills is an expiring contract who will likely rarely see the floor or will get traded TORONTO RECEIVES Russell Westbrook OKC RECEIVES Kyle Lowry Norman Powell Toronto st Round Top Protected Toronto st Round Top Protected Why Lol why would both parties agree to this Toronto fearful of Lowry s departure makes a move that shocks the world trading him for another star PG Westbrook is better than Lowry but losing him changes Toronto s whole scheme Regardless Westbrook has bigs who can stretch the floor in Siakam and Gasol and off the bench he has his old teammate Serge His wings have room to grow in Ferguson and OG but still solid Van Vleet remains the face of the bench mob and can keep them in the game when Westbrook sits OKC with Lowry and Powell still have a sneaky team They have depth at the guard position and they could sneak in for that seed It would be another first round exit but OKC fans are already accustomed to that If Lowry leaves the Thunder would have a max slot available for them to use in UTAH RECEIVES Russell Westbrook OKC RECEIVES Mike Conley George Niang Jazz st Round Lottery Protected Why Utah taking the gamble on the Superstar fitting well with Mitchell isn t the worst idea The Jazz are put a spot where this is there best shot at winning a title and Conley is a great PG don t get me wrong but he isn t a superstar like Russ Westbrook has shooters such as Bojan and Jingles and I think him and Mitchell would be able to push each other OKC taking Conley would make it so they have a better version of the Clippers in my opinion and they would be geared to face the seed Clippers I think if OKC wants to pull the trigger on this deal they would be a playoff team still WASHINGTON RECEIVES Russell Westbrook OKC RECEIVES John Wall Rui Hachimura Troy Brown Jr Ian Mahinmi Why Only a team without a GM would make this move Westbrook got a star guard in Beal that compliments him very well along with knockdown shooter Miles and Bertans The Wizards can make a playoff push with this team and we could see Thomas Bryant win MIP Schofield and Wagner looks promising enough and IT hopefully can return to at least of his Boston self Brooks may elevate his coaching when around his former star PG OKC getting John Wall could allow them to tank the first season and get pieces around him Hachimura I believe will have a Giannis like rise in the league and he fills in the position well Troy Brown also has through the roof potential that was not shown because of Brooks stubbornness to play him Mahimni is expiring away ,t3_cavgfa

Adam Morrison was the better basketball player than Brian Scalabrine,I would like to begin by saying I am neither a Lakers or Celtics fan I have no goat in this race However I find it greatly disrespectful that people are so quick to say that Brian Scalabrine was the better basketball player Yes Scal has had the better career with the longevity but Morrison had a higher peak Brian never averaged double digits in a season Adam averaged PPG as a rookie before injury derailed his career Despite this injury Adam has rings in seasons Brian has ring in seasons If you don t care about the rings argument then it s important to understand that Adam and Brian actually went head to head in the Finals Adam tallied points rebounds and an assist in that finals Brian had points rebounds assists Adam did this with diabetes by the way Jordan always gets praise for playing with the flu but let s be honest you would take the flu over diabetes Anyways no disrespect to Brian Scalabrine But I feel like we can appreciate Brian s greatness without diminishing ignoring Adam s ,t3_cbict0
Who says no? (another Westbrook trade), teams OKC Portland Cleveland Detroit Detroit Russ Cavs Whiteside Portland first Detroit first both unprotected Portland Gallinari Love OKC Jackson Snell Galloway Bazemore Detroit Portland I think Portland says no because this leaves them pretty thin at center until Nurkic comes back but I could be wrong They pick up a solid wing scorer which they need and Love They go all in on this season ,t3_cbk0b2
"[Serious] When judging the GOATs, how much do you guys weight playoff performance vs regular season performance?",I always found this to be an interesting question For example Harden is a better regular season player than Kawhi but Kawhi seems to be the better playoff performer so how do you weight those two options There are other examples such as Kyrie Irving vs Kemba Walker etc ,t3_cbmwfx
"Looking back,when KD got mad at that press conference in Feburary and told everyone to ""grow up"" he knew they were onto him going to Brooklyn.",I remember how pissed off he was at every media member especially Ethan Sherwood Strauss for writing an article on the Athletic that he was leaving for NY He was so sour and didn t want to talk about the Porzingis trade and how it opened up cap space to sign in NY Clearly thats what he wanted and was just mad that people were onto him ,t3_cbmw6f
"Other than rookies, the Clippers haven't made anything official yet. Do they have something up their sleeve?",Kawhi and PG I get not being official but seems odd that even the much earlier June July stuff hasn t even been made official Yes the Sixers haven t announced Horford for example but the Clips have decent flexibility for other moves given all their previous contracts unlike Philly in conclusion f ,t3_cbdpnk
"Ignore contracts, who would you rather have as the center piece of your team for the next 3 years: Harden, Kawhi or Steph?",Pretty straightforward question Again ignore contracts as that always complicates things But between these players who would you choose to build around for the next years Steph has the most offensive gravity out of all of them Harden is probably the best creator scorer out of all of them Kawhi is the best defender and better playoff performer it seems out of all of them debatable though What do you think ,t3_cbmswl

What teams do you think will under perform compared to expectations this season?,Teams like the clippers and lakers have added a lot of new players so i think they may need time to gel and might not start off that well Plus load management of stars could also contribute to them having a worse record than what people think What other teams do you guys think will underperform ,t3_cbel7o

Realistic Ceiling/Comparison for Zion,Zion is without a doubt the most hyped prospect since Lebron James and one of the most popular players on the planet A lot of people are saying he has HOF potential and that he is the future face of the league What is the best player comparison for him what is a realistic prediction of what his career will end up like I hear a lot of Charles Barkley Blake Griffin Julius Randle and some others saying Larry Johnson and Shawn Kemp ,t3_cbi1g4
How will westbrooks game change under a new coach?,Westbrook is talented and the only one in the league to average a triple double that said tho its partly a product of Billy s coaching schemes having bigs box out and guards get the rebound Will Westbrooks rebounds take a hit Or will the new team he s on build around his playstyle I love westbrook and he made the Thunder my favorite west coast team Curious to see how he ll fair on another team hopefully with a good coach,t3_cbi17c

Opinions on D lo and his future?,I think D lo is a tough player ot analyze and has become controversial lately Forgetting all the overrated or udnerrated crap what do you guys think he can and become I get going Kyrie over him but D lo for me has lots of potential The stats make him look like a complete ball hogger bt you watch him play he has shown the ability to really play point gaurd and facilitate I really believe he can be a top three passer in the NBA and people I feel don t see that I always see Harden comparisons but the guy can be like Cp at times the way he control the offense and the guy has a midrange jumper that I feel can be elite with the best I think D lo can be like Kyle Lowry achievement wise where he can get you a couple more all star games and a winning player I think to past players he compares a lot to Gilbert Arenas and Chauncey Billups style wise His defense and finishing is the big concern but I ve seen him and I believe he can work on it I honestlythink his defense concerns are exagerrated and his finishing has shown good potential I think he is misunderstood and still faces tons of adversity from fans To be honest to b really biased I still feel he can be really better than realistic expectations say He faces a lot of adversity and I think has a lot of potential to improve At worst I still think he can become Lou Williams or Eric Gordon ,t3_cbm3ie
Russell Westbrook Trade Idea,Saw this elsewhere and wanted to hear some other thoughts Russel goes to Magic Gordon Fultz salary filler and a st go to Thunder I think this is pretty decent Thunder get Russ off the books and get back a good trade able deal in Gordon and at worst a short expiring contract in Fultz Magic just signed Vuce to big money and this way they will for sure be at least a little noisy in the east and get star power they would never be able to sign otherwise None of their young guys are stars so why not ,t3_cbm31n

How different would the NBA be if signings/transfers were more similar to soccer?,Main differences in transfers off the top of my head In soccer you can sign someone without trading for them Most transfers don t actually include a trade all the leagues I can think of don t have a salary cap for player wages If a team wants to sign a player they have to make an offer to the player s current team and once the current team accepts an offer the interested team can negotiate with the player for salary The player can stop a trade at this stage If a player has an amount stated for a release clause example $ million the current team can t stop a trade if the amount offered meets that release clause Players can be loaned out Many teams loan out younger players to give them experience on year deals The team loaning the players often has to pay the players salary for that year Some loan deals include pre established transfer amounts example if an unnecessary players market value is $ million and if he goes for a year loan to a smaller team the current team can say you can sign him for $ million Add anything else I might have missed or any mistakes I might made ,t3_cbhh1e

Correct me if I'm Wrong: But Wouldn't Expansion Screw With Draft Pick Protections In The Worst Way?,TLDR Most draft pick protection language equivalency only works right now because there are teams If executives ever start changing their language in trades seemingly for no reason on pick protections executives think expansion in the near future is a possibility Top protected conveyed if or conveyed for the last ten spots in the first round Three different phrases that currently mean the same thing only because there are thirty teams But in a team league that would be conveys if Protected and Protected Expansions seriously screw with draft pick protections in trades I ll use the least serious but most affected The top protected second round pick Top Protected picks Right now with teams with rounds the following statements are equivalent Protected Protected Top Conveys if or Lower Conveys if Protected for the first positions of the second round Protected For All But The Last Positions of the Second Round But with teams these statements are no longer equivalent Protected Does Not Convey if or Higher Conveys if or Lower Top Protected Obviously this means that the second round pick remains with the team if it falls in positions through However with expansion teams picks and are no longer in the second round They are in the first round A pick can t be protected across two rounds So this means that any pick with expansion is protected instead Fine Any pick lower than is conveyed But there s no longer spots in the second round there s This is what most trades are presumed to have But it means the pick is more valuable than it was when it was traded I assume this is what the league would go with considering the language UNLESS But every so often there s a trade that uses this language Conveys Protected if This means that pick conveys if the position is and only So if it falls at the pick would not fall under the traded protection with this language This is not the same as the original scenario and it opens up a can of worms These positions didn t exist when the trade was made so this means that the team trading the pick gets a huge advantage because instead of there being out of a possible positions the pick could convey it s out of This could be problematic If the trading team has the trade that it only conveys but the receiving team has the trade as Top protected then there s a difference in the trade The Anthony Davis trade has pick protections of on the Lakers first Not conveyed if If there were thirty two teams what about positions and Protected For All But The Last Positions of the Round This is the one that really shifts the trade Because instead of the receiving team getting the pick if its now they can only get it if it s That s very different This is the language that would cause the most problems Fortunately I don t know of a trade that uses this phrase But if we see this phrase it would be a dead give away that something s up Remember in a team league this is the same as top protected so the language would go through Protected for the first X positions of the round This is another phrase that I don t think is ever used but this one is in a different category The first twenty five positions in the second with a league of thirty teams in the second round are to The first twenty five positions in the second round with a league of thirty two teams are to This is a different outcome from any of the other possibilities as this gives the receiving team seven spots of You can do this for any protection scenario Lottery Protection or Top Protected Right now they re the same But Lottery Protected with teams means it s protected top not top I should note that according to my search on ProSports Transactions the phrase Lottery Protected hasn t been used in a trade since June well before the lockout but it only had four such appearances in transactions before Unlike top which has continued to be used Eh I m sure the league has plans in place right That or expansion teams can t enter the league for seven years after they ve been approved But this whole thing would remind of that whole Dillion Marshon Brooks fail ,t3_cbj0vi

This flagging a play thing could result in a very annoying end to nba games from here on out.,At the end of every very close nba game some has to take the final shot This can be to win or tie a game but regardless of the result a lot of times one team is yelling at the refs for rather a call or a lack thereof and the way I see this flagging a play thing working out is each team is going to inevitably save it for the end of the game and no matter the result of that final shot there will be a flag from a coach challenging the play This could be a blatant foul that was called or a clear block contest with no foul called but it will ALWAYS be challenged Think of the raptors winning the championship this year It was great and so exciting for so many people but for us watching the moment felt kind of underwhelming because everyone was excited when Kawhi got the ball in the final possesion but then a foul led to refs watching and watching to make sure they make the right call Everyone had already been yelling and getting excited that the raptors were going to win that when it became official it wasn t as exciting as when it wasn t official I m not saying by any means that reviewing or challenging shouldn t be a thing but just imagine EVERY single time a game is close and comes down to one possession multiple minutes of waiting cuts the excitement apart What do you guys think ,t3_cbhma2

"If your method of keeping up with the NBA is only through watching highlights, then your opinions and judgements on players is utterly worthless.",I think it should be pretty obvious that highlights don t show you the full picture Yet these days there seems to be a growing number of fans who only seem to watch basketball through FreeDawkins highlights and the like Sorry but if that s the only way you watch basketball then your opinions and judgements on players are worthless and shouldn t be taken seriously Even if thats the only way convenient for you because you live in a different country sorry but you don t understand the full game and full impact of a player ,t3_cbbe37
Let‚Äôs chat about the spurs....,Need to start this off by saying that I m a pistons and wizards fan not a spurs fan However I feel like the spurs are not getting enough respect for the team that they will have this coming season This is a team that looked like one of the best in the league over the last month or so of the regular reason They also took a very good nuggets team to game and if it were not for a team wide brain fart with not fouling they could have won They will be adding Murray back next season and Lonnie walker is looking to have taken it up a notch as well I think they are next seasons sleeper team in a wide open league Any thoughts ,t3_cbk7g8
"With all the discussion about how the supermax is flawed at it's core, can we acknowledge the irony in how it's played out?",The supermax is given to a Designated Veteran Player who has stayed on the team he was drafted to or was traded to on his rookie contract They must also either have made all NBA the year they signed the contract or previous seasons been named the DPOY the year they signed the contract or previous seasons been named NBA in the past seasons Such players have the option of getting the Designated Veteran Player Extension DVPE aka the Kevin Durant Rule This is because KD left the Thunder to join the Warriors in a case where a smaller market team failed to incentive a star to stay when bigger market teams Ironically the first major NBA player who was eligible for the supermax was Boogie Cousins The Kings chose not to sign him as the commitment was not worth it and clearly they made the right choice Boogie eventually decided to go to GSW So right there we see that the supermax was turned down by a team who was unwilling to commit to a player for that much time and money and this directly benefited the Warriors On the flipside OKC was able to motivate Russell Westbrook to sign the DPVE supermax instead of allowing him to leave OKC Perhaps this is a sign that the supermaxes are functioning as intended No of course not This backfired in OKC as now Wesbtrook s contract makes him very hard to move In this way the supermax has really hurt the Thunder Other examples include John Wall s supermax which has essentially killed Washington s chances at competing or blowing their team up and Anthony Davis turning down the supermax to join the Lakers ,t3_cbbtn8
[Discussion] Is the West playoff race basically 5 teams for one spot?,Obviously injuries change things and clearly I m not considering seeding issues But it seems like most people are pretty much assuming the top seeds from last season GS Den Por and Hou are still strong enough to make the playoffs and the improvements to both LA teams and Utah have them virtually locked If this plays out to form then there is only one spot left for teams like SA Sac Minn Dallas and NO and that s assuming OKC trades Russ for a tank commander Aside from potential injuries is there any reason to assume that more than one of those teams could make a serious playoff push ,t3_cbccns

"R/NBA and the media wants to burn the burn the Spurs organization for misdiagnosis. However looking back 2 years later, were the Spurs right all along? This is a synopsis of the Kawhi saga till now.",Kawhi Leonard had an injury in the Spurs diagnosed it as tendinopathy It s a pain that will always linger will need rest but will not get better or worse Did the Spurs give Kawhi rest Did his injury get better The answer in yes and no For as much as Raptors fans want to give their medical staff credit for load management they quickly forget that the Spurs created player rest before it became envogue The Spurs paid all the fines while everyone else got on board The Spurs also only played Kawhi games that year He essentially took the entire year off What happened during that year Kawhi worked with the Spurs medical staff and several of his own outside doctors and they all came up with the same thing It was reported that he saw outside doctors and got the same diagnosis Pop asked his camp to allow them to shut him down for the season Kawhi s camp refused Its reported that Uncle Denis didn t like the way the Spurs organization was trying to control things However of course Kawhi is still getting paid million and mostly not even sitting on the bench The classy organization that San Antonio is allowed Kawhi to save face by constantly saying that Kawhi really wants to play and he is working hard at getting back Despite San Antonio s class Kawhi s camp starts leaking that he wants out and wants to go to LA This was first reported by the Jaylen Rose on First Take The Spurs denied it and kept talking about how hard Kawhi was working to get back However things began to grow contentious between the Spurs and Kawhi s camp Kawhi s camp cut off communication with the Spurs as he sought his own medical opinion even further The Spurs would usually send a team medical rep to Kawhis doctors appointments with his outside opinion but his camp started preventing this He was still getting paid but would not speak to any team officials Sometime around the all star break his teammates wanted to know if he was in or out This meeting angered Kawhi and his camp put out even more leaks that he wanted to be traded and he demanded that he will only play for LA Tony Parker came out and said his injury was a hundred times worst This quote was taken out of context He said that he understood what Kawhi was going through and his injury was a times worst but the media ran with it To be fair Tony has a history of putting his foot in his mouth Kawhi s camp used this to fuel the fire for his exit He would not even support his team on the bench during the playoffs He wouldn t speak to the media and thus left his teammates to answer questions for him As admitted by Danny Green this was hard on them since he wasn t talking to any of them either However he did keep collecting checks Finally the team trades Kawhi at his request It was first reported that he would not play for the Raptors but this would require him to forfeit his free agency per the CBA because THERE WAS NOT A DIAGNOSIS that said he could not play Not even from his own doctors He was just trying to prevent a trade to the Raptors The Raptors medical staff came up with the SAME DIAGNOSIS AS THE SPURS medical staff It was still tendinopathy It was not going to get better or worse Rest helps but it would always linger To win him over the Raptors medical staff rested him nearly of the season after he rested almost an entire season with the Spurs The Spurs diagnosis still proved true After the year off with the Spurs and all the loadmanagement nonsense he was still in pain after playing a few games in the post season Its exactly what the Spurs said Rest will help but the pain will always exist and he will always have to play through it Kawhi s camp continued to take jabs at the organization telling the media to report things like the Spurs would not put anybody around him They got him LaMarcus who was the top FA of his class People also forget that before Durant joined the Warriors the Spurs were one of the teams he took a meeting with Nobody remembers because the Spurs are too classy to blast him for it but Kawhi would not show up to the meeting He refused to show up to the meeting that would have resulted in a Spurs team of Durant LaMarcus and Kawhi People also forget that the Spurs tried trade for Kyrie Once the post season arrived he played through it He had to He had to show top free agents that he wanted to team up with in LA that he could still play when it mattered He had planned all along to team up with a star on the Clippers Once LeBron signed with the Lakers his camp sent word that he wanted the Clippers Somehow Raptors fans thought they did something the Spurs had never done for Kawhi and that he might stay with them They gave uncle Denis free reign They promised to house and feed him as a country They begged for more years on the float They even gave him house warning gifts All along Kawhi knew that he wanted no parts of the North Kawhi sent the fans all the signals by saying things like this is something they could build on He told fans to just enjoy this moment He used it as a singular term He was never going to stay He had plans for the Clippers all along The whole time he had the Lakers and Raptors waiting he was trying to recruit KD Kyrie and Paul George but only to the Clippers The Clippers even tried to get him Jimmy Butler Kawhi was only recruiting them to the Clippers Not to the Raptors and if the Lakers were an option he would not be recruiting other stars They already had Its likely that the reporters that were reporting that the Lakers and Raptors were his likely destination were not the frauds you accuse them to be but they were most likely Kawhi s camp leaking it to the media for his own gain Neither team was an option He used the Raptors private jet to take meetings with the Lakers He moved the Lakers meeting so that he could meet with PG Kawhi didn t want any of the organizations leaking any info If they did it would possibly blow up his plan He waited see if PG can force his way out of OKC one year into his max deal He wanted to force the clippers to go all in His sister led social media account kept it going by saying how Kawhi and his family love Canada He didn t have that leverage without other teams in the mix so he used real threats in the Lakers and Raptors years later we look back He was diagnosed by the Spurs doctors as having tendinopathy It was not going to get better or worse Rest helps but it would always linger It proved true After the year off with the Spurs and all the load management he was still in pain a few games into the playoffs The Spurs were never an evil empire They invented rest and they even recommend players get their own second opinion according to Manu Kawhi wanted what he wanted KAWHI HAS A CONDITION NOT AN INJURY Torronto can be happy he led them to their only championship but they were a means to an end and an opportunity to rehab his reputation He will have the problem his entire career The Lakers were the rival team he wanted to weaken as much as possible by having them wait to fill out their roster AD could have kept his million It was the Clippers all along Kawhi may seem quiet but he moves in cut throat silence TLDR He was diagnosed by Spurs doctors as having tendinopathy He has a condition not an injury It was not going to get better or worst Rest helps but it would always linger That is exactly what the Spurs told him It proved true After the year off with the Spurs and all the loadmanagement nonsense he was still in pain He had to play through the off season because it was a contract year Edit Kawhi sat out nearly of the season not This offended many Raptors fans I apologize its corrected Also Spurs diagnosed him with tendinopathy ,t3_cap64u

How could Russell Westbrook find his form again?,I think it s going to be a combination of things He NEEDS to stop jacking s Despite having the third worst shooting season of his career he took the second most threes per game in his career He needs to cut down on his PA and only take open and spot up shots One thing that he has going for him is that he just had his third best season from the corner shooting If he cut down his three point attempts to just spot ups and wide open shots his efficiency would go up he needs to make his free throws He just had his worst free throw shooting season of his career from the line a mind boggling worse than his next worse season In his MVP season he shot on attempts per game I think the best thing for Russ is going to be a change of scenery he needs a coach that he respects but also a coach that won t put up with his shit I think that s why Miami is the best possible place for him Spo isn t gonna tolerate a Marcus Smart level shooter taking threes per game I think if he ends up in Detroit it s gonna be more of the same for Russ ,t3_cbjjmt

Kevin Durant has a 7 3pm as his single game career high.,Wiggins was absolutely cooking tonight A career high threes I decided to check KD s high because with the shot selection he had playing for us I thought he d have around Guess what No His career high is Don t get me wrong is still very good but it was surprising to see that he didn t shoot that much with us though I remember all of his contested pullups that could only swish regardless Also KD has never made threes in a single season and his shot selection volume has barely been affected by the point revolution It may seem as if it s a shot I m taking on KD but really it s not His consistent scoring all over the place gets even more remarkable tbh Being such a killer without jacking up threes left and right like most players in the league do and still be deadly from deep is imo what accounts for KD having those silent pts games on ridiculous efficiency Just some thoughts edit volume instead of selection Sorry English not my strong suit ,t3_rau7cm

What‚Äôs the most fun playoff series you‚Äôve ever watched that didn‚Äôt involve your team?,For me it s gotta be the Eastern Conference Semifinals between the Raptors and Sixers that went down to a game buzzer beater by Kawhi Leonard That series felt like a war between two teams that were convinced was their year and for the Raptors it was The disappointment from the Sixers after game was palpable punctuated by the raw emotion from Embiid postgame It just felt like a series where both teams gave it their all and either would have been a deserving winner ,t3_ragzqj

12 teams are within 2 games of .500 - why?,What are your theories for the seemingly increased parity this years Is it the rule changes stars starting off slow or simply an increased balance in the league You can even extend that to make it so that teams half the league are within games of I ve followed the league since the early to mid s and can t recall a tighter race this far into the season Any team goes on a game winning streak or skid really separates themselves from the pack ,t3_rawnvn
